<pre>public final class NormalizerInput extends Object implements com.upokecenter.text.ICharacterInput
</pre>

<p>A character input class that implements the Unicode normalization
 algorithm and contains methods and functionality to test and convert
 text strings for normalization. This is similar to the deprecated
 Normalizer class, except it implements the ICharacterInput
 interface.</p> <p>The Unicode Standard includes characters, such as
 an acute accent, that can be combined with other characters to make
 new characters. For example, the letter E combines with an acute
 accent to make E-acute (&#xc9;). In some cases, the combined form
 (E-acute) should be treated as equivalent to the uncombined form (E
 plus acute). For this reason, the standard defines four
 <i>normalization forms</i> that convert strings to a single
 equivalent form:</p> <ul> <li><b>NFD</b> (Normalization Form D)
 decomposes combined forms to their constituent characters (E plus
 acute, for example). This is called canonical decomposition.</li>
 <li><b>NFC</b> does canonical decomposition, then combines certain
 constituent characters to their composites (E-acute, for example).
 This is called canonical composition.</li> <li>Two normalization
 forms, <b>NFKC</b> and <b>NFKD</b>, are similar to NFC and NFD,
 except they also "decompose" certain characters, such as ligatures,
 font or positional variants, and subscripts, whose visual distinction
 can matter in some contexts. This is called compatibility
 decomposition.</li> <li>The four normalization forms also enforce a
 standardized order for combining marks, since they can otherwise
 appear in an arbitrary order.</li></ul> <p>For more information, see
 Standard Annex 15 at <code>http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/</code>.</p>
