<h1>com.upokecenter.mail.Message</h1>

<pre>public final class Message extends Object
</pre>

<p>Represents an email message, and contains methods and properties for
 accessing and modifying email message data. This class implements the
 Internet Message Format (RFC 5322) and Multipurpose Internet Mail
 Extensions (MIME; RFC 2045-2047, RFC 2049).</p> <p><b>Thread
 safety:</b> This class is mutable; its properties can be changed.
 None of its instance methods are designed to be thread safe.
 Therefore, access to objects from this class must be synchronized if
 multiple threads can access them at the same time.</p> <p>The
 following lists known deviations from the mail specifications
 (Internet Message Format and MIME):</p> <ul> <li>The
 content-transfer-encodings "quoted-printable" and "base64" are
 treated as 7bit instead if they occur in a message or body part with
 content type "multipart/*" or "message/*" (other than
 "message/global", "message/global-headers",
 "message/global-disposition-notification", or
 "message/global-delivery-status").</li> <li>If a message has two or
 more Content-Type header fields, it is treated as having a content
 type of "application/octet-stream", unless one or more of the header
 fields is syntactically invalid.</li> <li>Illegal UTF-8 byte
 sequences appearing in header field values are replaced with
 replacement characters. Moreover, UTF-8 is parsed everywhere in
 header field values, even in those parts of some structured header
 fields where this appears not to be allowed. (UTF-8 is a character
 encoding for the Unicode character set.)</li> <li>This implementation
 can parse a message even if that message is without a From header
 field, without a Date header field, or without both.</li> <li>The To
 and Cc header fields are allowed to contain only comments and
 whitespace, but these "empty" header fields will be omitted when
 generating.</li> <li>There is no line length limit imposed when
 parsing header fields, except header field names.</li> <li>There is
 no line length limit imposed when parsing quoted-printable or base64
 encoded bodies.</li> <li>If the transfer encoding is absent and the
 content type is "message/rfc822", bytes with values greater than 127
 (called "8-bit bytes" in the rest of this summary) are still allowed,
 despite the default value of "7bit" for
 "Content-Transfer-Encoding".</li> <li>In the following cases, if the
 transfer encoding is absent, declared as 7bit, or treated as 7bit,
 8-bit bytes are still allowed:</li> <li>(a) The preamble and epilogue
 of multipart messages, which will be ignored.</li> <li>(b) If the
 charset is declared to be <code>utf-8</code>.</li> <li>(c) If the content
 type is "text/html" and the charset is declared to be
 <code>us-ascii</code>, "windows-1252", "windows-1251", or "iso-8859-*" (all
 single byte encodings).</li> <li>(d) In non-MIME message bodies and
 in text/plain message bodies. Any 8-bit bytes are replaced with the
 substitute character byte (0x1a).</li> <li>If the message starts with
 the word "From" (and no other case variations of that word) followed
 by one or more space (U + 0020) not followed by colon, that text and
 the rest of the text is skipped up to and including a line feed
 (U+000A). (See also RFC 4155, which describes the so-called "mbox"
 convention with "From" lines of this kind.)</li> <li>The name
 <code>ascii</code> is treated as a synonym for <code>us-ascii</code>, despite
 being a reserved name under RFC 2046. The name <code>cp1252</code> is
 treated as a synonym for <code>windows-1252</code> , even though it's not
 an IANA registered alias.</li> <li>The following deviations involve
 encoded words under RFC 2047:</li> <li>(a) If a sequence of encoded
 words decodes to a string with a CTL character (U + 007F, or a
 character less than U + 0020 and not TAB) after being converted to
 Unicode, the encoded words are left un-decoded.</li> <li>(b) This
 implementation can decode encoded words regardless of the character
 length of the line in which they appear. This implementation can
 generate a header field line with one or more encoded words even if
 that line is more than 76 characters long. (This implementation
 follows the recommendation in RFC 5322 to limit header field lines to
 no more than 78 characters, where possible.)</li></ul> <p>It would be
 appreciated if users of this library contact the author if they find
 other ways in which this implementation deviates from the mail
 specifications or other applicable specifications.</p> <p>Note that
 this class currently doesn't support the "padding" parameter for
 message bodies with the media type "application/octet-stream" or
 treated as that media type (see RFC 2046 sec. 4.5.1).</p> <p>Note
 that this implementation can decode an RFC 2047 encoded word that
 uses ISO-2022-JP (the only supported encoding that uses code
 switching) even if the encoded word's payload ends in a different
 mode from "ASCII mode". (Each encoded word still starts in "ASCII
 mode", though.) This, however, is not a deviation to RFC 2047 because
 the relevant rule only concerns bringing the output device back to
 "ASCII mode" after the decoded text is displayed (see last paragraph
 of sec. 6.2) -- since the decoded text is converted to Unicode rather
 than kept as ISO-2022-JP, this is not applicable since there is no
 such thing as "ASCII mode" in the Unicode Standard.</p> <p>Note that
 this library (the MailLib library) has no facilities for sending and
 receiving email messages, since that's outside this library's
 scope.</p>
