     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, arr, zerosAtEnd=False)
     |      Binary expansion of a real number in [0, 1], initialized
     |      from an array of zeros and ones expressing the binary
     |      expansion.
     |      The first binary digit is the half digit, the second
     |      is the quarter digit, the third is the one-eighth digit,
     |      and so on.  Note that the number 1 can be
     |      expressed by passing an empty array and specifying
     |      zerosAtEnd = False, and the number 0 can be
     |      expressed by passing an empty array and specifying
     |      zerosAtEnd = True.
     |      arr - Array indicating the initial digits of the binary
     |      expansion.
     |      zerosAtEnd - Indicates whether the binary expansion
     |      is expressed as 0.xxx0000... or 0.yyy1111... (e.g., 0.1010000...
     |      vs. 0.1001111....  Default is the latter case (False).

     |      Creates a binary expansion object from a fraction, 'int', or
     |      'float' in the interval [0, 1]; resets 'f' (calls its reset method) otherwise.

    class BringmannLarsen(builtins.object)
     |  Implements Bringmann and Larsen's sampler, which chooses a random number in [0, n)
     |  where the probability that each number is chosen is weighted.  The 'weights' is the
     |  list of weights each 0 or greater; the higher the weight, the greater
     |  the probability.  This sampler supports only integer weights.
     |  This is a succinct (space-saving) data structure for this purpose.

    class ConvexPolygonSampler(builtins.object)
     |  A class for uniform random sampling of
     |  points from a convex polygon.  This
     |  class only supports convex polygons because
     |  the random sampling process involves
     |  triangulating a polygon, which is trivial
     |  for convex polygons only. "randgen" is a RandomGen
     |  object, and "points" is a list of points
     |  (two-item lists) that make up the polygon.

    class DensityInversionSampler(builtins.object)
     |  A sampler that generates random samples from
     |    a continuous distribution for which
     |    only the probability density function (PDF) is known,
     |    using the inversion method.  This sampler
     |    allows quantiles for the distribution to be calculated
     |    from pregenerated uniform random numbers in [0, 1].
     |
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF. It takes a single
     |    number and outputs a single number. The area under
     |    the PDF need not equal 1 (this sampler works even if the
     |    PDF is only known up to a normalizing constant).
     |  - bl, br - Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  Both
     |     bl and br are numbers giving the domain,
     |     which in this case is [bl, br].  For best results, the
     |     probabilities outside the sampling domain should be
     |     negligible (the reference cited below uses cutoff points
     |     such that the probabilities for each tail integrate to
     |     about ures*0.05 or less).
     |  - ures - Maximum approximation error tolerable, or
     |    "u-resolution".  Default is 10^-8.  This error tolerance
     |    "does not work for continuous distributions [whose PDFs
     |    have] high and narrow peaks or poles".  This sampler's
     |    approximation error will generally be less than this tolerance,
     |    but this is not guaranteed, especially for PDFs of the kind
     |    just mentioned.

     |
     |  codegen(self, name='dist')
     |      Generates standalone Python code that samples
     |              (approximately) from the distribution estimated
     |              in this class.  Idea from Leydold, et al.,
     |              "An Automatic Code Generator for
     |              Nonuniform Random Variate Generation", 2001.
     |      - name: Distribution name.  Generates Python methods called
     |         sample_X (samples one random number), and quantile_X
     |         (finds the quantile
     |         for a uniform random number in [0, 1]),
     |         where X is the name given here.
     |
     |  quantile(self, v)
     |      Calculates quantiles from uniform random numbers
     |            in the interval [0, 1].
     |      - v: A list of uniform random numbers.
     |      Returns a list of the quantiles corresponding to the
     |      uniform random numbers.  The returned list will have
     |      the same number of entries as 'v'.
     |
     |  sample(self, rg, n=1)
     |      Generates random numbers that (approximately) follow the
     |            distribution modeled by this class.
     |      - n: The number of random numbers to generate.
     |      Returns a list of 'n' random numbers.

    class DensityTiling(builtins.object)
     |  Produces a tiling of a probability density function (PDF)
     |       for the purposes of random number generation.  The PDF is
     |       decomposed into tiles; these tiles will either cross the PDF
     |       or go below the PDF.  In each recursion cycle, each tile is
     |       split into four tiles, and tiles that end up above the PDF are
     |       discarded.
     |
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF. It takes a single
     |    number and outputs a single number. The area under
     |    the PDF need not equal 1 (this class tolerates the PDF even if
     |    it is only known up to a normalizing constant).  For best results,
     |    the PDF should be bounded from above (that is, it should be free of _poles_, or points
     |    that approach infinity).  If the PDF does contain a pole, this class
     |    may accommodate the pole by sampling from a modified version of the PDF,
     |    so that points extremely close to the pole may be sampled
     |    at a higher or lower probability than otherwise (but not in a way
     |    that significantly affects the chance of sampling points
     |    outside the pole region).
     |  - bl, br - Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  Both
     |     bl and br are numbers giving the domain,
     |     which in this case is [bl, br].
     |  - cycles - Number of recursion cycles in which to split tiles
     |     that follow the PDF.  Default is 8.

    class KVectorSampler(builtins.object)
     |  A K-Vector-like sampler of a continuous distribution
     |  with a known cumulative distribution function (CDF).
     |  Uses algorithms
     |  described in Arnas, D., Leake, C., Mortari, D., "Random
     |  Sampling using k-vector", Computing in Science &
     |  Engineering 21(1) pp. 94-107, 2019, and Mortari, D.,

     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, cdf, xmin, xmax, pdf=None, nd=200)
     |      Initializes the K-Vector-like sampler.
     |      Parameters:
     |      - cdf: Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
     |         distribution.  The CDF must be
     |         monotonically increasing everywhere in the
     |         interval [xmin, xmax] and must output values in [0, 1];
     |         for best results, the CDF should
     |         be increasing everywhere in [xmin, xmax].
     |      - xmin: Maximum x-value to generate.
     |      - xmax: Maximum x-value to generate.  For best results,
     |         the range given by xmin and xmax should cover all or
     |         almost all of the distribution.
     |      - pdf: Optional. Distribution's probability density
     |         function (PDF), to improve accuracy in the root-finding
     |         process.
     |      - nd: Optional. Size of tables used in the sampler.
     |         Default is 200.
     |
     |  quantile(self, uniforms)
     |      Returns a list of 'n' numbers that correspond
     |      to the given uniform random numbers and follow
     |      the distribution represented by this sampler.  'uniforms'
     |      is a list of uniform random values in the interval
     |      [0, 1].  For best results, this sampler's range
     |      (xmin and xmax in the constructor)
     |      should cover all or almost all of the desired distribution and
     |      the distribution's CDF should be monotonically
     |      increasing everywhere (every number in the distribution's
     |      range has nonzero probability of occurring), since
     |      among other things,
     |      this method maps each uniform value to the
     |      range of CDFs covered by this distribution (that is,
     |      [0, 1] is mapped to [minCDF, maxCDF]), and
     |      uniform values in "empty" regions (regions with
     |      constant CDF) are handled by replacing those
     |      values with the minimum CDF value covered.
     |
     |  sample(self, rg, n)
     |      Returns a list of 'n' random numbers of

     |  supported on [0, 1] and bounded from above.
     |  Note that this sampler currently relies on floating-point operations
     |  and thus the evaluations of the PDF (the distribution's probability
     |  density function) could incur rounding errors.
     |  - pdf: PDF, which takes a value in [0, 1] and returns a probability
     |    density at that value (which is 0 or greater).  Currently,
     |    the PDF must be monotone (either increasing or decreasing).

    class RandomGen(builtins.object)
     |  A class that implements many methods for
     |  random number generation and sampling.  It takes
     |  an underlying RNG as specified in the constructor.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, rng=None)
     |      Initializes a new RandomGen instance.
     |      NOTES:
     |
     |      1. Assumes that 'rng' implements
     |      a 'randint(a, b)' method that returns a random
     |      integer in the interval [a, b].  Currently, this
     |      class assumes 'a' is always 0.
     |      2. 'rndint' (and functions that ultimately call it) may be
     |      slower than desirable if many random numbers are
     |      needed at once.  Ways to improve the performance
     |      of generating many random numbers at once include
     |      vectorization (which is often PRNG specific) and multithreading
     |      (which is too complicated to show here).
     |
     |  ball_point(self, dims, radius=1)
     |      Generates an independent and uniform random point inside a 'dims'-dimensional
     |      ball (disc, solid sphere, etc.) centered at the origin.
     |
     |  bernoulli(self, p)
     |      Returns 1 at probability p, 0 otherwise.
     |
     |  beta(self, a, b, nc=0)
     |      Generates a beta-distributed random number.
     |      `a` and `b` are the two parameters of the beta distribution,
     |      and `nc` is a parameter such that `nc` other than 0
     |      indicates a _noncentral_ distribution.

     |  derangement_algorithm_s(self, list)
     |      Returns a copy of 'list' with each of its elements
     |      moved to a different position (a derangement),
     |      but with the expected number of cycle lengths
     |      in probability, even though the list
     |      need not be a uniformly randomly

     |  discretegen(self, probs)
     |      Generates a random integer in [0, n), where the probability
     |      of drawing each integer is specified as a list
     |      of probabilities that sum to 1, where n is the
     |      number of probabilities.  This method is optimal,
     |      or at least nearly so, in terms of the number of random
     |      bits required to generate the number
     |      on average. This method implements
     |      a solution to exercise 3.4.2 of chapter 15 of Luc Devroye's
     |      _Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation_, 1986.
     |
     |      - probs.  List of probability objects, where for each item
     |         in the probability list, the integer 'i' is chosen
     |         with probability 'probs[i]'.
     |         Each probability object provides access to a binary
     |         expansion of the probability, which must be a real number in
     |         the interval [0, 1]. The binary expansion is a sequence of zeros and ones
     |         expressed as follows: The first binary digit is the half digit, the second
     |         is the quarter digit, the third is the one-eighth digit,
     |         and so on. Note that any probability with a terminating binary
     |         expansion (except 0) can be implemented by "subtracting" 1
     |         from the expansion and then appending an infinite sequence
     |         of ones at the end. The probability object must implement the following
     |         three methods:
     |         - reset(): Resets the probability object to the first digit in
     |            the binary expansion.
     |         - nextbit(): Gets the next digit in the binary expansion.
     |         - eof(): Gets whether the end of the binary expansion was reached
     |            (True or False), meaning the rest of the digits in the expansion are
     |            all zeros.
     |         The probability object will have to be mutable for this method
     |         to work.
     |         The BinaryExpansion class is a convenient way to express numbers
     |         as probability objects that meet these criteria.  Each probability object
     |         can also be a float, int, or Fraction in the interval [0, 1].

     |  expoNumerator(self, denom)
     |      Generates the numerator of an exponential random
     |      number with a given denominator,
     |      using von Neumann's
     |      algorithm ("Various techniques used in connection with
     |      random digits", 1951).
     |
     |  expoRatio(self, base, rx=1, ry=1)
     |      Generates an exponential random number
     |      (in the form of a ratio, or two-element list) given
     |      the rate `rx`/`ry` and the base `base`.
     |      The number will have the denominator `base*rx`.
     |
     |  exponential(self, lamda=1.0)
     |
     |  exprandfill(self, a, bits)
     |      Fills the unsampled bits of the given exponential random number
     |      'a' as necessary to make a number whose fractional part
     |      has 'bits' many bits.  If the number's fractional part already has
     |      that many bits or more, the number is rounded using the round-to-nearest,
     |      ties to even rounding rule.  Returns the resulting number as a
     |      multiple of 2^'bits'.
     |
     |  exprandless(self, a, b)
     |      Determines whether one partially-sampled exponential number
     |      is less than another; returns
     |      True if so and False otherwise.  During
     |      the comparison, additional bits will be sampled in both numbers
     |      if necessary for the comparison.
     |
     |  exprandnew(self, lamdanum=1, lamdaden=1)
     |      Returns an object to serve as a partially-sampled
     |      exponential random number with the given
     |      rate 'lamdanum'/'lamdaden'.  The object is a list of five numbers:
     |      the first is a multiple of 1/(2^X), the second is X, the third is the integer
     |      part (initially -1 to indicate the integer part wasn't sampled yet),
     |      and the fourth and fifth are the lamda parameter's
     |      numerator and denominator, respectively.  Default for 'lamdanum'
     |      and 'lamdaden' is 1.
     |      The number created by this method will be "empty"
     |      (no bits sampled yet).

     |      Generates a uniform random number contained in a box described
     |          by the given universal dyadic decomposition code.
     |          - code: A list returned by the getDyadicDecompCode
     |            or getDyadicDecompCodePdf method.

     |         _k_ times.  The estimated bias is then `(k-1)/GammaDist(r, 1)`,
     |         where _r_ is the total number of coin flips."

     |      coin: A function that returns 1 (or heads) with unknown probability and 0 otherwise.
     |      k: Number of times the coin must return 1 (heads) before the estimation
     |          stops.
     |          To ensure an estimate whose relative error's absolute value exceeds
     |          epsilon with probability at most delta, calculate the smallest
     |          integer k such that:
     |             gammainc(k,(k-1)/(1+epsilon)) +
     |                 (1 - gammainc(k,(k-1)/(1-epsilon))) <= delta
     |          (where gammainc is the regularized lower incomplete gamma function,
     |          implemented, e.g., as scipy.special.gammainc), and set this parameter
     |          to the calculated k value or higher.
     |          The default is 385, which allows the relative error to exceed 0.1 (epsilon) with
     |          probability at most 0.05 (delta).
     |          A simpler suggestion is k>=ceiling(-6*ln(2/delta)/((epsilon**2)*(4*epsilon-3))).
     |          For both suggestions, epsilon is in the interval (0, 3/4) and delta is in (0, 1).
     |          Note: "14/3" in the paper should probably read "4/3".

     |      Generates an independent and uniform random
     |      point on the surface of a geoellipsoid.  The
     |      geoellipsoid uses the following parameters:
     |      a - semimajor axis (distance from the center of
     |         the geoellipsoid to the equator).  The default
     |         is the WGS 84 ellipsoid's semimajor axis
     |         in kilometers.
     |      invf - inverse flattening.  The default is the
     |         WGS 84 ellipsoid's inverse flattening.

     |  geometric(self, p)
     |
     |  getDyadicDecompCode(self, point, f=None, fbox=None)
     |      Finds a code describing the position and size of a box that covers the given
     |      point in the universal dyadic decomposition for random number generation.
     |      - point: A list of coordinates of a point in space.  This method assumes
     |        the point was a randomly generated member of a geometric set (such as a
     |        sphere, ellipse, polygon, or any other volume).  Let N be the number
     |        of coordinates of this parameter (the number of dimensions).
     |      - f: A function that determines whether a point belongs in the geometric set.
     |        Returns True if so, and False otherwise.  This method takes as input a list
     |        containing N coordinates describing a point in space.  If this parameter is
     |        given, this method assumes the geometric set is convex (and this method
     |        may return incorrect results for concave sets), because the method checks
     |        only the corners of each box to determine whether the box is entirely included
     |        in the geometric set.
     |      - fbox: A function that determines whether a box is included
     |        in the geometric set. This method takes
     |        as input a list containing N items, where each item is a list containing the
     |        lowest and highest value of the box for the corresponding dimension.  Returns 0 if the
     |        box is entirely outside the set, 1 if the box is partially inside the set (or if the
     |        method is not certain whether the box is inside or outside the set), and 2
     |        if the box is entirely inside the set.
     |      Returns a list containing two items. The first describes the size of the box
     |      (as a negative power of 2). The second is a list of coordinates describing the
     |      position.  Let v be 2**-ret[0].  The box is then calculated as (ret[1][0]*v,
     |      ret[1]*v+v), ..., (ret[1][n-1]*v, ret[1][n-1]*v+v).
     |      Raises an error if the point was determined not to belong in the geometric set.
     |      Either f or fset must be passed to this method, but not both.

     |  getDyadicDecompCodePdf(self, point, pdf=None, pdfbounds=None, precision=53)
     |      Finds a code describing the position and size of a box that covers the given
     |      point in the universal dyadic decomposition for random number generation,
     |      based on a non-uniform probability density function.  It generates a
     |      random number for this purpose, so the return value may differ from call to
     |      call.
     |      - point: A list of coordinates of a point in space.  This method assumes
     |        the point was random generated and within the support of a continuous
     |        distribution.  Let N be the number of coordinates of this parameter
     |        (the number of dimensions).
     |      - pdf: The probability density function (PDF) of the continuous distribution.
     |        This method takes as input a list
     |        containing N coordinates describing a point in space, and returns the probability
     |        density of that point as a single number.  If this parameter is given, however:
     |        - This method assumes the PDF is unimodal and monotone at all points
     |          away from the mode, and may return incorrect results if that is not the case.
     |        - If the given PDF outputs floating-point numbers, the resulting
     |          dyadic decomposition code may be inaccurate due to rounding errors.
     |      - pdfbounds: A function that returns the lower and upper bounds of the PDF's value
     |        at a box. This method takes as input a list containing N items, where each item
     |        is a list containing the lowest and highest value of the box for the
     |        corresponding dimension.  Returns a list
     |        containing two items: the lower bound and the upper bound, respectively, of the
     |        PDF anywhere in the given box.  If this parameter is
     |        given, this method assumes the PDF is continuous almost everywhere and bounded
     |        from above; the dyadic decomposition will generally work only if that is the case.
     |      - precision: Precision of random numbers generated by this method, in binary digits
     |        after the point.  Default is 53.
     |      Returns a list containing two items. The first describes the size of the box
     |      (as a negative power of 2). The second is a list of coordinates describing the
     |      position.  Let v be 2**-ret[0].  The box is then calculated as (ret[1][0]*v,
     |      ret[1]*v+v), ..., (ret[1][n-1]*v, ret[1][n-1]*v+v).
     |      Raises an error if the point is determined to be outside the support of the PDF.
     |      Either pdf or pdfbounds must be passed to this method, but not both.

     |  integersWithSum(self, n, total)
     |      Returns a list of 'n' integers 0 or greater that sum to 'total'.

     |      possible combinations.
     |
     |  integers_from_pdf(self, pdf, mn, mx, n=1)
     |      Generates one or more random integers from a discrete probability
     |      distribution expressed as a probability density
     |      function (PDF), which is also called the probability mass
     |      function for discrete distributions.  The random integers
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  `n` random integers will be
     |      generated. `pdf` is the PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, a weight indicating the relative likelihood
     |      that a random integer will equal that parameter.
     |      The area under the "curve" of the PDF need not be 1.

     |      follow a discrete distribution, assuming the distribution
     |            produces only integers 0 or greater.
     |            - `u01` is a list of uniform random numbers, in [0, 1].
     |            - `pmf` is the probability mass function (PMF)
     |            of the discrete distribution; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |            for that parameter, the probability that a random number is
     |            equal to that parameter (each probability is in the interval [0, 1]).
     |            The area under the PMF must be 1; it
     |            is not enough for the PMF to be correct up to a constant.
     |
     |  intsInRangeSortedWithSum(self, numSamples, numPerSample, mn, mx, sum)

     |       'numPerSample' numbers each, where each

     |  intsInRangesWithSum(self, numSamples, ranges, total)
     |      Generates one or more combinations of

     |       combination's numbers sum to 'total', and each number
     |       has its own valid range.  'ranges' is a list of valid ranges
     |       for each number; the first item in each range is the minimum
     |       value and the second is the maximum value.  For example,
     |       'ranges' can be [[1,4],[3,5],[2,6]], which says that the first
     |       number must be in the interval [1, 4], the second in [3, 5],
     |       and the third in [2, 6].
     |        The combinations are chosen uniformly at random.
     |           Neither the integers in the 'ranges' list nor
     |       'total' may be negative.  Returns an empty
     |       list if 'numSamples' is zero.

     |      Metropolis--Hastings.  The resulting random pairs
     |      are not independent, but are often close to
     |      being independent.  'pdf' takes one parameter,
     |      namely, a list of two numbers giving a sampled
     |      point and returns a number 0 or greater.

     |      Generates one or more random numbers from a continuous probability
     |      distribution by numerically inverting its cumulative
     |      distribution function (CDF).
     |
     |      - cdf: The CDF; it takes one parameter and returns,

     |      be less than or equal to that parameter.
     |      - mn, mx: Sampling domain.  The random number
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].

     |  numbers_from_dist(self, pdf, mn=0, mx=1, n=1, bitplaces=53)
     |      Generates 'n' random numbers that follow a continuous
     |      distribution in an interval [mn, mx].  The distribution's
     |      PDF (probability density function) must be bounded from above
     |      (have a finite value) and be continuous almost everywhere
     |      in the interval.  Implements section 4 of Devroye and Gravel,
     |      "The expected bit complexity of the von Neumann rejection
     |      algorithm", arXiv:1511.02273v2  [cs.IT], 2016.
     |      - 'n' is the number of random numbers to generate.  Default is 1.
     |      - 'pdf' is a procedure that takes three arguments: xmin, xmax, bitplaces,
     |         and returns an array of two items: the greatest lower bound of f(x) anywhere
     |         in the interval [xmin, xmax] (where f(x) is the PDF), and the least upper
     |         bound of f(x) anywhere there.  Both bounds are multiples of 2^-bitplaces.
     |      - 'bitplaces' is an accuracy expressed as a number of bits after the
     |         binary point. The random number will be a multiple of 2^-bitplaces,
     |         or have a smaller granularity. Default is 53.
     |      - 'mn' and 'mx' express the interval.  Both are optional and
     |         are set to 0 and 1, respectively, by default.

     |      - 'n' is the number of random numbers to generate.  Default is 1.
     |      - 'icdf' is a procedure that takes three arguments: u, ubits, digitplaces,
     |         and returns a number within base^-digitplaces of the True inverse
     |         CDF (inverse cumulative distribution function, or quantile function)
     |         of u/base^ubits, and is monotonic for a given value of `digitplaces`.
     |      - 'digitplaces' is an accuracy expressed as a number of digits after the
     |         point. Each random number will be a multiple of base^-digitplaces,
     |         or have a smaller granularity. Default is 53.
     |      - base is the digit base in which the accuracy is expressed. Default is 2
     |         (binary). (Note that 10 means decimal.)
     |
     |  numbers_from_pdf(self, pdf, mn, mx, n=1, steps=100)
     |      Generates one or more random numbers from a continuous probability
     |      distribution expressed as a probability density
     |      function (PDF).  The random number
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  `n` random numbers will be
     |      generated. `pdf` is the PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, a weight indicating the relative likelihood
     |       that a random number will be close to that parameter. `steps`
     |      is the number of subintervals between sample points of the PDF.
     |      The area under the curve of the PDF need not be 1.
     |      By default, `n` is 1 and `steps` is 100.
     |
     |  numbers_from_u01(self, u01, pdf, cdf, mn, mx, ures=None)
     |      Transforms one or more random numbers into numbers
     |      (called quantiles) that follow a continuous probability distribution, based on its PDF
     |      (probability density function) and/or its CDF (cumulative distribution
     |      function).
     |
     |      - u01: List of uniform random numbers in [0, 1] that will be
     |      transformed into numbers that follow the distribution.
     |      - pdf: The PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, the relative probability that a
     |      random number close to that number is chosen.  The area under
     |      the PDF need not be 1 (this method works even if the PDF
     |      is only known up to a normalizing constant). Optional if a CDF is given.
     |      - cdf: The CDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, the probability that a random number will
     |      be less than or equal to that parameter. Optional if a PDF is given.
     |      For best results, the CDF should be
     |      monotonically increasing everywhere in the
     |      interval [xmin, xmax] and must output values in [0, 1];
     |      for best results, the CDF should
     |      be increasing everywhere in [xmin, xmax].
     |      - mn, mx: Sampling domain.  The random number
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  For best results,
     |      the range given by mn and mx should cover all or
     |      almost all of the distribution.
     |      - ures - Maximum approximation error tolerable, or
     |      "u-resolution".  Default is 10^-8. The underlying sampler's approximation
     |      error will generally be less than this tolerance, but this is not guaranteed.
     |      Currently used only if a
     |      PDF is given.
     |
     |  pareto(self, minimum, alpha)
     |
     |  partialshuffle(self, list, k)
     |      Does a partial shuffle of
     |      a list's items (stops when 'k' items
     |      are shuffled); the shuffled items
     |      will appear at the end of the list.
     |      Returns 'list'.

     |      successful trials (sx/sy), where the probability of success in
     |      each trial is px/py.

     |  quantile_urands(self, icdf, urands, digitplaces=53)
     |      Finds the quantile of 'n' uniform random numbers expressed as "u-rands", or partially-sampled uniform random numbers (Karney, "Sampling exactly from the normal distribution").  Implements section 5 of Devroye and Gravel,  "Sampling with arbitrary precision", arXiv:1502.02539v5 [cs.IT], 2015.
     |      - 'urands' is a list of "u-rands", or partially-sampled uniform random numbers.  Each u-rand is a list of two items, namely a multiple of 1/2^X, followed by X.  For example, the following generates a list of five empty
     |      u-rands: `[[0,0] for i in range(5)]`.
     |      - 'icdf' is a procedure that takes three arguments: u, ubits, digitplaces,
     |         and returns a number within 2^-digitplaces of the True inverse
     |         CDF (inverse cumulative distribution function, or quantile function)
     |         of u/2^ubits, and is monotonic for a given value of `digitplaces`.
     |      - 'digitplaces' is an accuracy expressed as a number of bits after the
     |         point. Each quantile will be a multiple of 2^-digitplaces,
     |         or have a smaller granularity. Default is 53.
     |
     |      Example:  The following example generates the maximum of 10
     |      random numbers, to an accuracy of 2^53.
     |
     |      ur=randgen.kthsmallest_urand(10, 10)

     |      Generates 'n' random numbers that follow
     |      the probability density given in 'pdf' using
     |      slice sampling.  The resulting random numbers
     |      are not independent, but are often close to
     |        being independent.  'pdf' takes one number as
     |        a parameter and returns a number 0 or greater.
     |        The area under the curve (integral) of 'pdf'
     |        need not be equal to 1. 'xstart' should be
     |      chosen such that `pdf(xstart)>0`.
     |
     |  spsa_minimize(self, func, guess, iterations=200, constrain=None, a=None, c=None, acap=None)
     |      Tries to find a choice of parameters that minimizes the value
     |      of a scoring function, also called the objective function or loss
     |      function, starting from an initial guess.  This method uses an
     |      algorithm called "simultaneous perturbation
     |      stochastic approximation", which is a randomized
     |      search for the minimum value of the objective function.
     |      func - Objective function, a function that calculates a score for the
     |       given array of parameters and returns that score.  The score is a
     |       single number; the lower the score, the better.
     |       The score can be negative.  (Note that the problem of maximizing
     |       the score is the same as minimizing it except
     |       that the score's sign is reversed at the end.)
     |      guess - Initial guess for the best choice of parameters.  This is an
     |       array of parameters, each of which is a number. This array has
     |       as many items as the array passed to 'func'.
     |      iterations - Maximum number of iterations in which to run the
     |       optimization process.  Default is 200.
     |      constrain - Optional. A function that takes the given array of
     |       parameters and constrains them to fit the bounds of a valid
     |       array of parameters. This function modifies the array in place.
     |      a - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; greater than 0.
     |      c - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; greater than 0. As a guideline,
     |        'c' is about equal to the "standard deviation of the measurement noise"
     |        for several measurements at the initial guess, and is a "small positive
     |        number" if measurements are noise-free (Spall 1998).  Default
     |        is 0.001.
     |      acap - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; an
     |        integer greater than 0.

    class RatioOfUniformsTiling(builtins.object)
     |  Produces a tiling for the purposes
     |       of fast sampling from a probability distribution via the
     |       ratio of uniforms method.
     |
     |  - pdf: The probability density function (PDF); it takes one parameter and returns,
     |     for that parameter, the relative probability that a
     |     random number close to that number is chosen.  The area under
     |     the PDF need not be 1; this method works even if the PDF
     |     is only known up to a normalizing constant, and even if
     |     the distribution has infinitely extending tails to the left and/or right.
     |     However, for the ratio of uniforms method to work, both pdf(x) and
     |     x*x*pdf(x) must be bounded from above (thus, if the distribution has
     |     tails, they must drop off at a faster than quadratic rate).
     |  - mode: X-coordinate of the PDF's highest peak or one of them,
     |     or a location close to it.  Optional; default is 0.
     |  - y0, y1: Bounding coordinates for the ratio-of-uniforms tiling.
     |     For this class to work, y0 <= min( x*sqrt(pdf(x)) ) and
     |     y1 >= max( x*sqrt(pdf(x)) ) for all x.  Optional; the default is y0=-10, y1=10.
     |  - cycles - Number of recursion cycles in which to split tiles
     |     for the ratio-of-uniforms tiling.  Default is 8.

FUNCTIONS
    numericalTable(func, x, y, n=100)

    urandfill(rg, a, bits=53)
        Fills the unsampled bits of the given u-rand 'a' as necessary to
              make a number with 'bits' many bits.  If the u-rand already has
              that many bits or more, the u-rand is rounded using the round-to-nearest,
              ties to even rounding rule.  Returns the resulting number as a
              multiple of 2^'bits'.  Default for 'bits' is 53.
        - rg: An object that must supply a 'randbit' method that generates an
          unbiased random bit.

    urandgreater(rg, a, b)
        Determines whether the first u-rand is greater than another u-rand; returns
              True if so and False otherwise.  During
              the comparison, additional bits will be sampled in both u-rands if necessary
              for the comparison.
        - rg: An object that must supply a 'randbit' method that generates an
          unbiased random bit.
         - a, b: The first and second u-rands.

    urandless(rg, a, b)
        Determines whether the first u-rand is less than another u-rand; returns
              True if so and False otherwise.  During
              the comparison, additional bits will be sampled in both u-rands if necessary
              for the comparison.
        - rg: An object that must supply a 'randbit' method that generates an
          unbiased random bit.
         - a, b: The first and second u-rands.

    urandnew()
        Returns an object to serve as a partially-sampled uniform random
        number called a "u-rand" (Karney, "Sampling exactly from the normal distribution").
        A u-rand is a list of two numbers: the first is a multiple of 1/(2^X), and the second is X.
        The urand created by this method will be "empty" (no bits sampled yet).

CLASSES

        Fixed

    class Fixed(builtins.object)
     |  Fixed-point numbers, represented using integers that store multiples
     |  of 2^-BITS.  They are not necessarily faster than floating-point numbers, nor
     |  do they necessarily have the same precision or resolution of floating-point
     |  numbers.  The main benefit of fixed-point numbers is that they improve
     |  determinism for applications that rely on non-integer real numbers (notably
     |  simulations and machine learning applications), in the sense that the operations
     |  given here deliver the same answer for the same input across computers,
     |  whereas floating-point numbers have a host of problems that make repeatable
     |  results difficult, including differences in their implementation, rounding
     |  behavior, and order of operations, as well as nonassociativity of
     |  floating-point numbers.
     |
     |  The operations given here are not guaranteed to be "constant-time"
     |  (non-data-dependent and branchless) for all relevant inputs.

    class Bernoulli(builtins.object)
     |  This class contains methods that generate Bernoulli random numbers,
     |     (either 1 or heads with a given probability, or 0 or tails otherwise).
     |     This class also includes implementations of so-called "Bernoulli factories", algorithms
     |  that turn coins biased one way into coins biased another way.

     |      - f: Function that returns 1 if heads and 0 if tails.
     |      - rng: Function that returns a non-negative integer at random.
     |        Example (Dughmi et al. 2017): if 'rng' is Poisson(lamda) we have

     |
     |  append_poly(self, result, poly)
     |      Appends a probability that the output die will land on
     |      a given number, in the form of a polynomial.
     |      result - A number indicating the result (die roll or coin
     |        flip) that will be returned by the _output_ coin or _output_
     |        die with the probability represented by this polynomial.
     |        Must be an integer 0 or greater.  In the case of dice-to-coins
     |        or coins-to-coins, must be either 0 or 1, where 1 means
     |        heads and 0 means tails.
     |      poly - Polynomial expressed as a list of terms as follows:
     |        Each term is a list of two or more items that each express one of
     |        the polynomial's terms; the first item is the coefficient, and
     |        the remaining items are the powers of the input die's
     |        probabilities.  The number of remaining items in each term
     |        is the number of faces the _input_ die has. Specifically, the
     |        term has the following form:
     |
     |        In the case of coins-to-dice or coins-to-coins (so the probabilities are 1-p and p,
     |        where the [unknown] probability that the _input_ coin returns 0
     |        is 1 - p, or returns 1 is p):
     |                 term[0] * p**term[1] * (1-p)**term[2].
     |        In the case of dice-to-dice or dice-to-coins (so the probabilities are p1, p2, etc.,
     |        where the [unknown] probability that the _input_ die returns
     |        0 is p1, returns 1 is p2, etc.):
     |                 term[0] * p1**term[1] * p2**term[2] * ... * pn**term[n].
     |
     |        For example, [3, 4, 5] becomes:
     |                 3 * p**4 * (1-p)**5
     |        As a special case, this list can contain two items and a zero is
     |        squeezed between the first and second item.
     |        For example, [3, 4] is the same as [3, 0, 4], which in turn becomes:
     |                 3 * p**4 * (1-p)**0 = 3 * p **4
     |
     |        For best results, the coefficient should be a rational number
     |        (such as int or Python's Fraction).
     |
     |        Each term in the polynomial must have the same number of items (except
     |        for the special case given above).  For example, the following is not a valid
     |        way to express this parameter:
     |                 [[1, 1, 0], [1, 3, 4, 5], [1, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]
     |        Here, the second term has four items, not three like the rest.
     |      Returns this object.
     |
     |  augment(self, count=1)
     |      Augments the degree of the function represented
     |      by this object, which can improve performance in some cases
     |      (for details, see the paper).
     |      - count: Number of times to augment the ladder.
     |      Returns this object.
     |
     |  next(self, coin)
     |      Returns the next result of the flip from a coin or die
     |      that is transformed from the given input coin or die by the function
     |      represented by this Dice Enterprise object.
     |      coin - In the case of coins-to-dice or coins-to-coins (see the "append_poly" method),
     |         this specifies the _input coin_, which must be a function that
     |         returns either 1 (heads) or 0 (tails).  In the case of dice-to-dice or dice-to-coins,
     |         this specifies an _input die_ with _m_ faces, which must be a
     |         function that returns an integer in the interval [0, m), which
     |         specifies which face the input die lands on.

        MooreSampler

    class MooreSampler(builtins.object)
     |  Moore rejection sampler, for generating independent samples
     |  from continuous distributions in a way that minimizes error,
     |  if the distribution's PDF (probability density function)
     |  uses "well-defined" arithmetic expressions.
     |  It can sample from one-dimensional or multidimensional
     |  distributions.  It can also sample from so-called "transdimensional
     |  distributions" if the distribution is the union of several component
     |  distributions that may have different dimensions and are associated
     |  with one of several _labels_.
     |
     |  Parameters:
     |
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF.  It takes a single parameter that
     |      differs as follows, depending on the case:
     |      - One-dimensional case: A single Interval. (An Interval is a mathematical
     |        object that specifies upper and lower bounds of a number.)
     |      - Multidimensional case: A list of Intervals, one for each dimension.
     |      - Transdimensional case (numLabels > 1): A list of two items: the Interval
     |         or Intervals, followed by a label number (an integer in [0, numLabels)).
     |      This function returns an Interval.  For best results,
     |      the function should use interval arithmetic throughout.  The area under
     |      the PDF need not equal 1 (this sampler works even if the PDF is only known
     |      up to a normalizing constant).
     |  - mn, mx: Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  There are three cases:
     |     - One-dimensional case: Both mn and mx are numbers giving the domain,
     |        which in this case is [mn, mx].
     |     - Multidimensional case: Both mn and mx are lists giving the minimum
     |        and maximum bounds for each dimension in the sampling domain.
     |        In this case, both lists must have the same size.
     |     - Transdimensional case: Currently, this class assumes the component
     |        distributions share the same sampling domain, which
     |        is given depending on the preceding two cases.
     |     For this sampler to work, the PDF must be "locally Lipschitz" in the
     |     sampling domain, meaning that the function is continuous everywhere
     |     in the domain, and has no slope that tends to a vertical slope anywhere in
     |     that domain.
     |  - numlabels: The number of labels associated with the distribution, if it's a
     |     transdimensional distribution.  Optional; the default is 1.
     |  - bitAccuracy: Bit accuracy of the sampler; the sampler will sample from
     |     a distribution (truncated to the sampling domain) that is close to the
     |     ideal distribution by 2^-bitAccuracy.  The default is 53.

     |

     |      Samples a number or vector (depending on the number of dimensions)
     |      from the distribution and returns that sample.
     |      If the sampler is transdimensional (the number of labels is greater than 1),
     |      instead returns a list containing the sample and a random label in the
     |      interval [0, numLabels), in that order.
