    class ConvexPolygonSampler(builtins.object)
     |  A class for uniform random sampling of
     |  points from a convex polygon.  This
     |  class only supports convex polygons because
     |  the random sampling process involves
     |  triangulating a polygon, which is trivial
     |  for convex polygons only. "randgen" is a RandomGen
     |  object, and "points" is a list of points
     |  (two-item lists) that make up the polygon.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, randgen, points)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

    class DensityInversionSampler(builtins.object)
     |  A sampler that generates random samples from
     |    a continuous distribution for which
     |    only the probability density function (PDF) is known,
     |    using the inversion method.  This sampler
     |    allows quantiles for the distribution to be calculated
     |    from pregenerated uniform random numbers in [0, 1].
     |
     |  - rg: A random generator (RandGen) object.
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF. It takes a single
     |    number and outputs a single number. The area under
     |    the PDF need not equal 1 (this sampler works even if the
     |    PDF is only known up to a normalizing constant).
     |  - bl, br - Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  Both
     |     bl and br are numbers giving the domain,
     |     which in this case is [bl, br].  For best results, the
     |     probabilities outside the sampling domain should be
     |     negligible (the reference cited below uses cutoff points
     |     such that the probabilities for each tail integrate to
     |     about ures*0.05 or less).
     |  - ures - Maximum approximation error tolerable, or
     |    "u-resolution".  Default is 10^-8.  This error tolerance
     |    "does not work for continuous distributions with high
     |    and narrow peaks or poles".

     |  quantile(self, v)
     |      Calculates quantiles from uniform random numbers
     |            in the interval [0, 1].
     |      - v: A list of uniform random numbers.

    class FastLoadedDiceRoller(builtins.object)
     |  Implements the Fast Loaded Dice Roller, which chooses a random number in [0, n)
     |  where the probability that each number is chosen is weighted.  The 'weights' is the
     |  list of weights each 0 or greater; the higher the weight, the greater
     |  the probability.  This sampler supports only integer weights.

    class KVectorSampler(builtins.object)
     |  A K-Vector-like sampler of a continuous distribution
     |  with a known cumulative distribution function (CDF).
     |  Uses algorithms
     |  described in Arnas, D., Leake, C., Mortari, D., "Random
     |  Sampling using k-vector", Computing in Science &
     |  Engineering 21(1) pp. 94-107, 2019, and Mortari, D.,
     |  Neta, B., "k-Vector Range Searching Techniques".
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, rg, cdf, xmin, xmax, pdf=None, nd=200)
     |      Initializes the K-Vector-like sampler.
     |      Parameters:
     |      - rg: A random generator (RandGen) object.
     |      - cdf: Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
     |         distribution.  The CDF must be
     |         monotonically nondecreasing everywhere in the
     |         interval [xmin, xmax] and must output values in [0, 1];
     |         for best results, the CDF should
     |         be increasing everywhere in [xmin, xmax].
     |      - xmin: Maximum x-value to generate.
     |      - xmax: Maximum y-value to generate.  For best results,
     |         the range given by xmin and xmax should cover all or
     |         almost all of the distribution.
     |      - pdf: Optional. Distribution's probability density
     |         function (PDF), to improve accuracy in the root-finding
     |         process.
     |      - nd: Optional. Size of tables used in the sampler.
     |         Default is 200.
     |
     |  invert(self, uniforms)
     |      Returns a list of 'n' numbers that correspond
     |      to the given uniform random numbers and follow
     |      the distribution represented by this sampler.  'uniforms'
     |      is a list of uniform random values in the interval
     |      [0, 1].  For best results, this sampler's range
     |      (xmin and xmax in the constructor)
     |      should cover all or almost all of the desired distribution and
     |      the distribution's CDF should be monotonically
     |      increasing everywhere (every number in the distribution's
     |      range has nonzero probability of occurring), since
     |      among other things,
     |      this method maps each uniform value to the
     |      range of CDFs covered by this distribution (that is,
     |      [0, 1] is mapped to [minCDF, maxCDF]), and
     |      uniform values in "empty" regions (regions with
     |      constant CDF) are handled by replacing those
     |      values with the minimum CDF value covered.
     |
     |  sample(self, n)
     |      Returns a list of 'n' random numbers of
     |      the distribution represented by this sampler.

    class PascalTriangle(builtins.object)
     |  Generates the rows of Pascal's triangle, or the

     |      values.
     |
     |  nextto(self, desiredRow)
     |      Generates the row of Pascal's triangle with the given row number,

     |      row-number-choose-k values.
     |

    class RandomGen(builtins.object)
     |  A class that implements many methods for
     |  random number generation and sampling.  It takes
     |  an underlying RNG as specified in the constructor.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, rng=None)
     |      Initializes a new RandomGen instance.
     |      NOTES:
     |
     |      1. Assumes that 'rng' implements
     |      a 'randint(a, b)' method that returns a random
     |      integer in the interval [a, b].  Currently, this
     |      class assumes 'a' is always 0.
     |      2. 'rndint' (and functions that ultimately call it) may be
     |      slower than desirable if many random numbers are
     |      needed at once.  Ways to improve the performance
     |      of generating many random numbers at once include
     |      vectorization (which is often PRNG specific) and multithreading
     |      (which is too complicated to show here).
     |
     |  ball_point(self, dims, radius=1)
     |      Generates an independent and uniform random point inside a 'dims'-dimensional
     |      ball (disc, solid sphere, etc.) centered at the origin.
     |
     |  bernoulli(self, p)
     |      Returns 1 at probability p, 0 otherwise.
     |
     |  beta(self, a, b, nc=0)
     |      Generates a beta-distributed random number.
     |      `a` and `b` are the two parameters of the beta distribution,
     |      and `nc` is a parameter such that `nc` other than 0
     |      indicates a _noncentral_ distribution.
     |
     |  binomial(self, trials, p)
     |
     |  binomial_int(self, trials, px, py)
     |
     |  cauchy(self)
     |
     |  choice(self, list)
     |
     |  diceRoll(self, dice, sides=6, bonus=0)
     |
     |  dirichlet(alphas)
     |
     |  expoNumerator(self, denom)
     |      Generates the numerator of an exponential random
     |      number with a given denominator,
     |      using von Neumann's
     |      algorithm ("Various techniques used in connection with
     |      random digits", 1951).
     |
     |  expoRatio(self, base, rx=1, ry=1)
     |      Generates an exponential random number
     |      (in the form of a ratio, or two-element list) given
     |      the rate `rx`/`ry` and the base `base`.
     |      The number will have the denominator `base*rx`.
     |
     |  exponential(self, lamda=1.0)
     |
     |  frechet(self, a, b, mu=0)
     |
     |  from_interp(self, table)
     |      Generates a random number given a list of CDF--number
     |      pairs sorted by CDF.
     |
     |      An example of this list is as follows.
     |      ` [[0.1, 0], [0.4, 1], [0.8, 2], [0.9, 3], [0.95, 4], [0.99, 5]]`
     |
     |      In this example, the first item of each pair is the value of
     |      a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and is in the interval [0, 1],
     |      and the second item is the number associated with that CDF's
     |      value. The random number will fall within the range of numbers
     |      suggested in the table, which will be in the interval [0, 5] in the
     |      example above.
     |
     |      The `numericalTable` method generates an appropriate table
     |      for this method's `table` parameter, given a CDF and a range
     |      of numbers.
     |
     |  gamma(self, mean, b=1.0, c=1.0, d=0.0)
     |      Generates a random number following a gamma distribution.
     |
     |  gaussian_copula(self, cov)
     |
     |  geoellipsoid_point(self, a=6378.137, invf=298.2572236)
     |      Generates an independent and uniform random
     |      point on the surface of a geoellipsoid.  The
     |      geoellipsoid uses the following parameters:
     |      a - semimajor axis (distance from the center of
     |         the geoellipsoid to the equator).  The default
     |         is the WGS 84 ellipsoid's semimajor axis
     |         in kilometers.
     |      invf - inverse flattening.  The default is the
     |         WGS 84 ellipsoid's inverse flattening.
     |
     |  geometric(self, p)
     |
     |  gumbel(self, a, b)
     |
     |  hypercube_point(self, dims, sizeFromCenter=1)
     |      Generates an independent and uniform random point on the surface of a 'dims'-dimensional
     |      hypercube (square, cube, etc.)
     |      centered at the origin.
     |
     |  hypergeometric(self, trials, ones, count)
     |
     |  hypersphere_point(self, dims, radius=1)
     |      Generates an independent and uniform random point on the surface of a 'dims'-dimensional
     |      hypersphere (circle, sphere, etc.)
     |      centered at the origin.
     |
     |  integersWithSum(self, n, total)
     |      "
     |      Returns a list of 'n' integers 0 or greater that sum to 'total'.
     |      The combination is chosen uniformly at random among all
     |      possible combinations.
     |
     |  integers_from_pdf(self, pdf, mn, mx, n=1)
     |      Generates one or more random integers from a discrete probability
     |      distribution expressed as a probability density
     |      function (PDF), which is also called the probability mass
     |      function for discrete distributions.  The random integers
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  `n` random integers will be
     |      generated. `pdf` is the PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, a weight indicating the relative likelihood
     |      that a random integer will equal that parameter.
     |      The area under the "curve" of the PDF need not be 1.
     |      By default, `n` is 1.
     |
     |  integers_from_u01(self, pmf, u01)
     |      Generates the quantiles for a list of uniform random numbers
     |      according to a discrete distribution, assuming the distribution
     |      produces only integers 0 or greater.
     |      - `pmf` is the probability mass function (PMF)
     |      of the discrete distribution; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, the probability that a random number is
     |      equal to that parameter (each probability is in the interval [0, 1]).
     |      The area under the PMF must be 1; it
     |      is not enough for the PMF to be correct up to a constant.
     |      - `u01` is a list of uniform random numbers, in [0, 1].
     |
     |  intsInRangeSortedWithSum(self, numSamples, numPerSample, mn, mx, sum)
     |      Generates one or more combinations of
     |       'numPerSample' numbers each, where each
     |       combination's numbers sum to 'sum' and are listed
     |       in sorted order, and each
     |       number is in the interval '[mn, mx]'.
     |        The combinations are chosen uniformly at random.
     |           'mn', 'mx', and
     |       'sum' may not be negative.  Returns an empty
     |       list if 'numSamples' is zero.
     |        The algorithm is thanks to a _Stack Overflow_
     |      answer (`questions/61393463`) by John McClane.
     |      Raises an error if there is no solution for the given
     |      parameters.
     |
     |  intsInRangeWithSum(self, numSamples, numPerSample, mn, mx, sum)
     |      Generates one or more combinations of
     |       'numPerSample' numbers each, where each
     |       combination's numbers sum to 'sum' and are listed
     |       in any order, and each
     |       number is in the interval '[mn, mx]'.
     |        The combinations are chosen uniformly at random.
     |           'mn', 'mx', and
     |       'sum' may not be negative.  Returns an empty

     |
     |  intsInRangesWithSum(self, numSamples, ranges, total)
     |      Generates one or more combinations of
     |       'len(ranges)' numbers each, where each
     |       combination's numbers sum to 'total', and each number
     |       has its own valid range.  'ranges' is a list of valid ranges
     |       for each number; the first item in each range is the minimum
     |       value and the second is the maximum value.  For example,
     |       'ranges' can be [[1,4],[3,5],[2,6]], which says that the first
     |       number must be in the interval [1, 4], the second in [3, 5],
     |       and the third in [2, 6].

     |      the probability density given in 'pdf' using
     |      a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm, currently
     |      Metropolis--Hastings.  The resulting random numbers
     |      are not independent, but are often close to
     |      being independent.  'pdf' takes one number as
     |      a parameter and returns a number 0 or greater.
     |      The area under the curve (integral) of 'pdf'
     |      need not be equal to 1.
     |
     |  mcmc2(self, pdf, n)
     |      Generates 'n' pairs of random numbers that follow
     |      the probability density given in 'pdf' using
     |      a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm, currently
     |      Metropolis--Hastings.  The resulting random pairs
     |      are not independent, but are often close to
     |      being independent.  'pdf' takes one parameter,
     |      namely, a list of two numbers giving a sampled
     |      point and returns a number 0 or greater.
     |      The volume under the surface (integral) of 'pdf'
     |      need not be equal to 1.
     |
     |  monte_carlo_integrate(self, func, bounds, samples=1000)

     |      an estimate using the help of randomization.
     |      func - Function to integrate.  Takes the same number
     |         of parameters as the length of bounds.
     |      bounds - Bounds of integration at each dimension.
     |         An N-length array of arrays.  Each array in turn
     |         contains two items: the lower bound and upper bound
     |         for that dimension.
     |      samples - Number of times to sample the bounds of
     |         integration randomly.  The default is 1000 samples.
     |      Returns an array containing two items: the estimated
     |      integral and the standard error.

     |      Generates one or more random numbers from a continuous probability
     |      distribution by numerically inverting its cumulative
     |      distribution function (CDF).  The random number
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  `n` random numbers will be
     |      generated. `cdf` is the CDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, the probability that a random number will
     |      be less than or equal to that parameter. `steps` is the number
     |      of subintervals between sample points of the CDF.
     |      By default, `n` is 1 and `steps` is 100.
     |

     |      Generates 'n' random numbers that follow a continuous
     |      distribution in an interval [mn, mx].  The distribution's
     |      PDF (probability density function) must be bounded
     |      (have a finite value) and be continuous almost everywhere
     |      in the interval.  Implements section 4 of Devroye and Gravel,
     |      "The expected bit complexity of the von Neumann rejection
     |      algorithm", arXiv:1511.02273v2  [cs.IT], 2016/2018.
     |      - 'n' is the number of random numbers to generate.  Default is 1.
     |      - 'pdf' is a procedure that takes three arguments: xmin, xmax, bitplaces,
     |         and returns an array of two items: the greatest lower bound of f(x) anywhere
     |         in the interval [xmin, xmax] (where f(x) is the PDF), and the least upper
     |         bound of f(x) anywhere there.  Both bounds are multiples of 2^-bitplaces.
     |      - 'bitplaces' is an accuracy expressed as a number of bits after the
     |         binary point. The random number will be a multiple of 2^-bitplaces,
     |         or have a smaller granularity. Default is 53.
     |      - 'mn' and 'mx' express the interval.  Both are optional and
     |         are set to 0 and 1, respectively, by default.
     |
     |  numbers_from_dist_inversion(self, icdf, n=1, digitplaces=53, base=2)

     |      or discrete probability distribution, using the inversion method.
     |      Implements section 5 of Devroye and Gravel,
     |      "Sampling with arbitrary precision", arXiv:1502.02539v5 [cs.IT], 2018.
     |      - 'n' is the number of random numbers to generate.  Default is 1.
     |      - 'icdf' is a procedure that takes three arguments: u, ubits, digitplaces,
     |         and returns a number within 2^-digitplaces of the true inverse
     |         CDF (inverse cumulative distribution function, or quantile function)
     |         of u/2^ubits.
     |      - 'digitplaces' is an accuracy expressed as a number of digits after the
     |         point. The random number will be a multiple of base^-digitplaces,
     |         or have a smaller granularity. Default is 53.
     |      - base is the digit base in which the accuracy is expressed. Default is 2
     |         (binary). (Note that 10 means decimal.)
     |
     |  numbers_from_pdf(self, pdf, mn, mx, n=1, steps=100)
     |      Generates one or more random numbers from a continuous probability
     |      distribution expressed as a probability density
     |      function (PDF).  The random number
     |      will be in the interval [mn, mx].  `n` random numbers will be
     |      generated. `pdf` is the PDF; it takes one parameter and returns,
     |      for that parameter, a weight indicating the relative likelihood
     |       that a random number will be close to that parameter. `steps`
     |      is the number of subintervals between sample points of the PDF.
     |      The area under the curve of the PDF need not be 1.
     |      By default, `n` is 1 and `steps` is 100.
     |
     |  pareto(self, minimum, alpha)
     |
     |  partialshuffle(self, list, k)
     |      Does a partial shuffle of
     |      a list's items (stops when 'k' items
     |      are shuffled); the shuffled items
     |      will appear at the end of the list.
     |      Returns 'list'.

     |      Generates 'n' random numbers that follow
     |      the probability density given in 'pdf' using
     |      slice sampling.  The resulting random numbers
     |      are not independent, but are often close to

     |        need not be equal to 1. 'xstart' should be
     |      chosen such that `pdf(xstart)>0`.
     |
     |  spsa_minimize(self, func, guess, iterations=200, constrain=None, a=None, c=None, acap=None)
     |      Tries to find a choice of parameters that minimizes the value
     |      of a scoring function, also called the objective function or loss
     |      function, starting from an initial guess.  This method uses an
     |      algorithm called "simultaneous perturbation
     |      stochastic approximation", which is a randomized
     |      search for the minimum value of the objective function.
     |      func - Objective function, a function that calculates a score for the
     |       given array of parameters and returns that score.  The score is a
     |       single number; the lower the score, the better.
     |       The score can be negative.  (Note that the problem of maximizing
     |       the score is the same as minimizing it except
     |       that the score's sign is reversed at the end.)
     |      guess - Initial guess for the best choice of parameters.  This is an
     |       array of parameters, each of which is a number. This array has
     |       as many items as the array passed to 'func'.
     |      iterations - Maximum number of iterations in which to run the
     |       optimization process.  Default is 200.
     |      constrain - Optional. A function that takes the given array of
     |       parameters and constrains them to fit the bounds of a valid
     |       array of parameters. This function modifies the array in place.
     |      a - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; greater than 0.
     |      c - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; greater than 0. As a guideline,
     |        'c' is about equal to the "standard deviation of the measurement noise"
     |        for several measurements at the initial guess, and is a "small positive
     |        number" if measurements are noise-free (Spall 1998).  Default
     |        is 0.001.
     |      acap - Optional.  A setting used in the optimization process; an
     |        integer greater than 0.
     |
     |  stable(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Generates a random number following a stable distribution.

     |      Generates a random number following a 'type 0' stable distribution.
     |
     |  surface_point(self, f, bounds, ngrad, gmax)
     |      Generates a uniform random point on
     |         a parametric surface, using a rejection
     |         approach developed by Williamson, J.F.,
     |         "Random selection of points distributed on
     |          curved surfaces", Physics in Medicine & Biology 32(10), 1987.
     |      - f: Takes two parameters (u and v) and returns
     |        a 3-element array expressing
     |        a 3-dimensional position at the given point.
     |      - bounds: Two 2-element arrays expressing bounds
     |        for u and v.  Of the form [[umin, umax], [vmin,
     |        vmax]].
     |      - ngrad: Takes two parameters (u and v) and returns
     |        the norm of the gradient (stretch factor)
     |        at the given point.  Can be None, in which
     |        the norm-of-gradient is calculated numerically.
     |      - gmax: Maximum norm-of-gradient
     |        for entire surface.
     |
     |  t_copula(self, cov, df)

    class Fixed(builtins.object)
     |  Fixed-point numbers, represented using integers that store multiples
     |  of 2^-BITS.  They are not necessarily faster than floating-point numbers, nor
     |  do they necessarily have the same precision or resolution of floating-point
     |  numbers.  The main benefit of fixed-point numbers is that they improve
     |  determinism for applications that rely on non-integer real numbers (notably
     |  simulations and machine learning applications), in the sense that the operations

CLASSES

        Bernoulli

    class Bernoulli(builtins.object)
     |  This class contains methods that generate Bernoulli random numbers,
     |     (either 1 or heads with a given probability, or 0 or tails otherwise).
     |     This class also includes implementations of so-called "Bernoulli factories", algorithms
     |  that turn coins biased one way into coins biased another way.

DESCRIPTION
    #  Implements the Moore Rejection Sampler.

        MooreSampler

    class MooreSampler(builtins.object)
     |  Moore rejection sampler, for generating independent samples
     |  from continuous distributions in a way that minimizes error,
     |  if the distribution's PDF (probability density function)
     |  uses "well-defined" arithmetic expressions.
     |  It can sample from one-dimensional or multidimensional
     |  distributions.  It can also sample from so-called "transdimensional
     |  distributions" if the distribution is the union of several component
     |  distributions that may have different dimensions and are associated
     |  with one of several _labels_.
     |
     |  Parameters:
     |
     |  - pdf: A function that specifies the PDF.  It takes a single parameter that
     |      differs as follows, depending on the case:
     |      - One-dimensional case: A single Interval. (An Interval is a mathematical
     |        object that specifies upper and lower bounds of a number.)
     |      - Multidimensional case: A list of Intervals, one for each dimension.
     |      - Transdimensional case (numLabels > 1): A list of two items: the Interval
     |         or Intervals, followed by a label number (an integer in [0, numLabels)).
     |      This function returns an Interval.  For best results,
     |      the function should use interval arithmetic throughout.  The area under
     |      the PDF need not equal 1 (this sampler works even if the PDF is only known
     |      up to a normalizing constant).
     |  - mn, mx: Specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.  There are three cases:
     |     - One-dimensional case: Both mn and mx are numbers giving the domain,
     |        which in this case is [mn, mx].
     |     - Multidimensional case: Both mn and mx are lists giving the minimum
     |        and maximum bounds for each dimension in the sampling domain.
     |        In this case, both lists must have the same size.
     |     - Transdimensional case: Currently, this class assumes the component
     |        distributions share the same sampling domain, which
     |        is given depending on the preceding two cases.
     |     For this sampler to work, the PDF must be "locally Lipschitz" in the
     |     sampling domain, meaning that the function is continuous everywhere
     |     in the domain, and has no slope that tends to a vertical slope anywhere in
     |     that domain.
     |  - numlabels: The number of labels associated with the distribution, if it's a
     |     transdimensional distribution.  Optional; the default is 1.
     |  - bitAccuracy: Bit accuracy of the sampler; the sampler will sample from
     |     a distribution (truncated to the sampling domain) that is close to the
     |     ideal distribution by 2^-bitAccuracy.  The default is 53.
     |

     |  Sainudiin, Raazesh, and Thomas L. York. "An Auto-Validating, Trans-Dimensional,
     |  Universal Rejection Sampler for Locally Lipschitz Arithmetical Expressions."

     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, pdf, mn, mx, numLabels=1, bitAccuracy=53)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |
     |  acceptRate(self)
     |
     |  sample(self)
     |      Samples a number or vector (depending on the number of dimensions)
     |      from the distribution and returns that sample.
     |      If the sampler is transdimensional (the number of labels is greater than 1),
     |      instead returns a list containing the sample and a random label in the
     |      interval [0, numLabels), in that order.
