class MooreSampler:
    """
    Moore rejection sampler, for sampling distributions whose
       PDF (probability density function) uses "well-defined" arithmetic
       expressions.  More formally, the PDF must be "locally Lipschitz", meaning
       that the function is continuous and has no slope that
       tends to a vertical slope anywhere in the sampling domain.
    - kf: PDF that takes a floating-point number or an Interval
       (a mathematical object that specifies upper and lower
      bounds of a number) and returns an Interval.  For best results,
      the PDF should use interval arithmetic throughout.
    - mn, mx: The interval [mn, mx] specifies the sampling domain of the PDF.

    TODO: Support multidimensional PDFs.
