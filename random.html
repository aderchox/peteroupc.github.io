<p>Most apps that use random numbers care about either unpredictability or speed/high quality.</p>

<p><a id=Introduction></a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As I see it, there are two kinds of random number generators (RNGs) needed by most applications, namely <em>statistical-random generators</em> and <em>unpredictable-random generators</em>.  I make this distinction because that is how programming languages often present random number generators -- they usually offer a general-purpose RNG (such as C&#39;s <code>rand</code> or Java&#39;s <code>java.util.Random</code>) and sometimes an RNG intended for security purposes (such as <code>java.security.SecureRandom</code>).  This page will discuss these two kinds of RNG, and make recommendations on their use and properties.</p>

<p>In addition, other applications require numbers that &quot;seem&quot; random but are based on an initial state, or &quot;seed&quot;.  This page will discuss when seeds should be used by applications.</p>

<p>Finally, this page will discuss issues on the practical use of RNGs in applications, namely, shuffling and two higher-level randomness methods.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>The following definitions are helpful in better understanding this document.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pseudorandom number generator (PRNG).</strong> A number generator that outputs seemingly random numbers using a deterministic algorithm, that is, an algorithm that returns the same output for the same state every time. (In this document, RNGs include PRNGs.)</li>
<li><strong>Seed.</strong>  Arbitrary data for initializing the state of a PRNG.</li>
<li><strong>state length.</strong>  The maximum size of the seed a PRNG can take to initialize its state without truncating or compressing that seed.</li>
<li><strong>Period.</strong> The number of random numbers a PRNG can generate in one sequence before the sequence repeats.  The period will not be greater than 2<sup><code>L</code></sup> where <code>L</code> is the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Unpredictable_Random_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Unpredictable-Random Generators</h2>

<p>Unpredictable-random implementations (also known as &quot;cryptographically strong&quot; or &quot;cryptographically secure&quot; RNGs) are indispensable in computer security and information security contexts, such as--</p>

<ul>
<li> generating keying material, such as encryption keys,</li>
<li> generating random passwords or session identifiers,</li>
<li> generating &quot;salts&quot; to vary cryptographic hashes of the same password,</li>
<li> use in secure communication protocols, and</li>
<li> use in networked games where predicting future random numbers would give a player an unfair advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are also useful in cases where the application generates random numbers so infrequently that the RNG&#39;s speed is not a concern.</p>

<p>The goal of this kind of generator is to keep the random numbers from being guessed easily.</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Quality:</strong> An unpredictable-random implementation generates uniformly random bits that are unpredictable. &quot;Unpredictable&quot; means that an outside party can guess neither prior nor future unseen bits of the random sequence correctly with more than a 50% chance per bit, even with knowledge of the randomness-generating procedure, the implementation&#39;s internal state at the given point in time, or extremely many outputs of the RNG. (If the sequence was generated directly by a PRNG, ensuring future bits are unguessable this way should be done wherever the implementation finds it feasible; see &quot;Seeding and Reseeding&quot;.)</li>
<li><p><strong>Seeding and Reseeding:</strong> The following applies only to implementations that use PRNGs.</p>

<p>The implementation must be automatically initialized (&quot;seeded&quot;) with an <em>unpredictable seed</em>, defined as follows. The seed--</p>

<ul>
<li>must consist of unpredictable data (as defined earlier), which ultimately derives from a nondeterministic source or sources and no part of which may be the PRNG&#39;s own output (such data may be mixed with other arbitrary data as long as the result is no less unpredictable), and</li>
<li>must be at least the same size as the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em> must be at least 128 bits and should be at least 256 bits.</p>

<p>The implementation should be reseeded from time to time (using a newly generated seed as described earlier) to help ensure the unpredictability of the output. If the implementation reseeds, it must do so before it generates more than 2<sup>67</sup> bits without reseeding and should do so  before it generates more than 2<sup>32</sup> bits without reseeding.</p></li>
<li> <strong>Speed:</strong> The implementation should select procedures that are reasonably fast for most applications.</li>
<li> <strong>Examples:</strong> Examples include the following:

<ul>
<li>The <code>/dev/random</code> device on many Unix-based operating systems, which generally uses only nondeterministic sources; thus, it can block for seconds at a time if not enough randomness (&quot;entropy&quot;) is available.</li>
<li>The <code>/dev/urandom</code> device on many Unix-based operating systems, which often rely on both a PRNG and the same nondeterministic sources used in <code>/dev/random</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>CryptGenRandom</code> method on Windows.</li>
<li>Cryptographic hash functions that take unpredictable signals as input (such as disk access timings, keystroke timings, thermal noise, and/or A. Seznec&#39;s hardware volatile entropy gathering and expansion technique).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;bytes&quot; is a pointer to a byte array, &quot;size&quot; is the number of random bytes to generate. Each bit in each byte will be randomly set to 0 or 1. Returns 0 if the method succeeds, and nonzero otherwise.</p>

<p>Note that an unpredictable-random implementation ultimately relies on one or more nondeterministic sources for random number generation.  Sources that are available in hardware and/or are reasonably fast for most applications (for instance, by producing many random numbers per second) are highly advantageous here, since an implementation for which such sources are available can rely less on PRNGs, which are deterministic and should be reseeded from time to time to help ensure unpredictability.</p>

<p><a id=Statistical_Random_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Statistical-Random Generators</h2>

<p>Statistical-random generators are used in simulations, in numerical integration, and in many games to bring an element of chance and variation to the application. This kind of generator is generally suitable only if--</p>

<ul>
<li> computer security and information security are not involved,</li>
<li> 20 or fewer items are being shuffled (in cases where the RNG is used for shuffling), and</li>
<li> the application generates random numbers so frequently that it would slow down undesirably if an unpredictable-random implementation were used instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this kind of generator is for each possible outcome to be equally likely.</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Quality:</strong> A statistical-random implementation generates random bits, each of which is uniformly randomly distributed independently of the other bits, at least for nearly all practical purposes. The implementation must be highly likely to pass known statistical randomness tests and must not show systematic failures in widely used statistical randomness test batteries. (Systematic failures in <code>TestU01</code>&#39;s <code>BigCrush</code> test battery [L&#39;Ecuyer and Simard 2007] are as defined in the <a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/#quality"><code>xoroshiro+</code> quality page</a>.)</li>
<li><p><strong>Seeding and Reseeding:</strong> The following applies only to implementations that use PRNGs.</p>

<p>The implementation must be automatically initialized (&quot;seeded&quot;) with a seed described as follows. The seed--</p>

<ul>
<li>must consist of data not known <em>a priori</em> by the implementation, such as random bits from an unpredictable-random implementation,</li>
<li>must not be a fixed value or a user-entered value,</li>
<li>should not be trivially predictable in any of its bits, as far as practical, and</li>
<li>must be at least the same size as the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em> must be at least 64 bits and should be at least 128 bits.</p>

<p>The implementation may reseed itself from time to time (using a newly generated seed as described earlier). It should do so if the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em> is less than 238 bits. If the implementation reseeds, it should do so before it generates more values than the square root of the PRNG&#39;s period without reseeding.</p></li>
<li> <strong>Speed:</strong> The implementation should select procedures that are reasonably fast for most applications. The implementation may instead use an unpredictable-random implementation as long as the method remains at least as fast, in the average case, as the statistical-random implementation it would otherwise use.</li>
<li> <strong>Examples:</strong> The <code>xorshift128+</code> and <code>Lehmer128</code> random number generators.</li>
<li> <strong>Non-Examples:</strong>  Mersenne Twister <a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/#quality">systematically fails</a> one of the <code>BigCrush</code> tests.  Any linear congruential generator with modulus 2<sup>63</sup> or less (such as <code>java.util.Random</code>) has a <em>state length</em> of less than 64 bits.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;bytes&quot; is a pointer to a byte array, &quot;size&quot; is the number of random bytes to generate. Each bit in each byte will be randomly set to 0 or 1. Returns 0 if the method succeeds, and nonzero otherwise.</p>

<p><a id=Seedable_Random_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Seedable Random Generators</h2>

<p>In addition, some applications use pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate results based on apparently-random principles, starting from a known initial state, or &quot;seed&quot;. One notable example is a &quot;code&quot;, or password, for generating a particular game level in some role-playing games.</p>

<p>Applications that need to specify their own seeds usually care about reproducible results. Such applications often need to keep not only the PRNG algorithm stable, but also any algorithm that uses that algorithm (such as a game level generator), especially if it publishes seeds (for example, game level passwords). (Note that in the definitions for <a href="#Unpredictable_Random_Generators">unpredictable-random</a> and <a href="#Statistical_Random_Generators">statistical-random</a> generators given earlier, the PRNGs involved are automatically seeded before use.)</p>

<p><a id=Seedable_PRNG_Recommendations></a></p>

<h3>Seedable PRNG Recommendations</h3>

<p>Which PRNG to use for generating reproducible results depends on the application. But here are some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li> Any PRNG algorithm selected for producing reproducible results should meet or exceed the quality requirements of a statistical-random implementation, and should be reasonably fast.</li>
<li> The PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em> should be 64 bits or greater.</li>
<li> Any seed passed to the PRNG should be at least the same size as the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Seeding_Recommendations></a></p>

<h3>Seeding Recommendations</h3>

<p>An application should use a PRNG with a seed it specifies (rather than another kind of RNG) only if--</p>

<ol>
<li>the initial state (the seed) which the &quot;random&quot; result will be generated from--

<ul>
<li>is hard-coded,</li>
<li>was entered by the user,</li>
<li>was generated using a statistical or unpredictable-random implementation (as defined earlier), or</li>
<li>is based on a timestamp (but only if the reproducible result is not intended to vary during the time specified on the timestamp and within the timestamp&#39;s granularity; for example, a year/month/day timestamp for a result that varies only daily),</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the application needs to generate the same &quot;random&quot; result multiple times,</li>
<li> the application finds it impractical to store or distribute that &quot;random&quot; result without having to a use a PRNG with an application-specified seed, such as--

<ul>
<li>  by saving the result to a file, or</li>
<li>  by distributing the results or the random numbers to networked users as they are generated, and</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the PRNG algorithm and any procedure using that algorithm to generate that &quot;random&quot; result will remain stable as long as the relevant feature is still in use by the application. (Not using seeding allows either to be changed or improved without affecting the application&#39;s functionality.)</li>
</ol>

<p><a id=Other_Situations></a></p>

<h3>Other Situations</h3>

<p>Seeds also come into play in other situations, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verifiable randomness.</strong> <em>Verifiable random numbers</em> are random numbers that are disclosed along with all the information required to verify their generation.  Usually, of the information used to derive such numbers, at least some of it is not known by anyone until some time after the announcement is made that those numbers will be generated, but all of it will eventually be publicly available.  In some cases, some of the information required to verify the numbers&#39; generation is disclosed in the announcement that those numbers will be generated.</p>

<p>One process to generate verifiable random numbers is described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3797.txt">RFC 3797</a> (to the extent its advice is not specific to the Internet Engineering Task Force or its Nominations Committee).  Although the source code given in that RFC uses the MD5 algorithm, the process does not preclude the use of hash algorithms stronger than MD5 (see the last paragraph of section 3.3 of that RFC).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Noise.</strong> Randomly generated numbers can serve as <em>noise</em>, that is, a randomized variation in images and sound.   The RNG used to generate the noise--</p>

<ul>
<li>must be an unpredictable-random implementation, if computer or information security is involved; otherwise,</li>
<li>must follow the <a href="#Seedable_PRNG_Recommendations">seedable PRNG recommendations</a>, if the <a href="#Seeding_Recommendations">seeding recommendations</a> apply to the noise generation; otherwise,</li>
<li>must be a statistical-random or unpredictable-random implementation, if the RNG is not used solely to generate noise; otherwise,</li>
<li>need only be as strong as required to achieve the desired effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>(A detailed description of noise algorithms, such as white, pink, or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise">colored noise</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a>, or fractal Brownian motion, is outside the scope of this page.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Using_Random_Number_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Using Random Number Generators</h2>

<p>The following topics deal with the practical use of RNGs in applications.  Unless stated otherwise,
they apply regardless of the kind of RNG used (such as an unpredictable-random or statistically
random implementation).</p>

<p><a id=Random_Number_Extraction></a></p>

<h3>Random Number Extraction</h3>

<p>Two methods given below can serve as building blocks for writing code that makes practical use
of randomness. Both methods assume the underlying RNG produces uniformly random bits.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first method is to generate a random integer from 0 inclusive to N exclusive (here
called <code>RNDINT(N)</code>), where N is an integer greater than 0. To do so, use the RNG to generate as many
random bits as used to represent N-minus-1, then convert those bits to a nonnegative integer.
If that nonnegative integer is N or greater, repeat this process.</li>
<li>The second method is to generate a random number from 0 inclusive to 1 exclusive. This can be
implemented by calling <code>RNDINT(X)</code> and dividing by X, where X is an integer which is the number of fractional parts between 0 and 1.  For 64-bit IEEE 854 floating-point numbers
(Java <code>double</code>), X will be 2<sup>53</sup>.  For 32-bit IEEE 854 floating-point numbers
(Java <code>float</code>), X will be 2<sup>24</sup>. (See &quot;Generating uniform doubles in the unit interval&quot; in the <a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/#remarks"><code>xoroshiro+</code> remarks page</a>
for further discussion.)</li>
</ol>

<p>A detailed discussion of other methods to generate random numbers or integers that
follow a given distribution, such as a normal, geometric, binomial, or discrete weighted
distribution, or that fall within a given range, is outside the scope of this page, however;  I have written about this in <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/randomfunc.html">another document</a>.</p>

<h2>Advice for New Programming Language APIs</h2>

<p>A programming language API could implement unpredictable-random and statistical-random RNGs
by filling an output byte buffer with random bytes, where each bit in each byte will be randomly
set to 0 or 1.  For instance, a C API for unpredictible-random generators could look like:
<code>int random_fast(uint8_t[] bytes, size_t size);</code>, where &quot;bytes&quot; is a pointer to a byte array, &quot;size&quot; is
the number of random bytes to generate, and where 0 is returned if the method succeeds and nonzero otherwise. </p>

<p>Any programming language API that implements such RNGs by filling a byte buffer must run in amortized
linear time on the number of bytes the API will fill.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, existing libraries or techniques that already meet the requirements should be used.
For example, an unpredictable-random implementation can read from the <code>/dev/urandom</code> and/or <code>/dev/random</code>
devices in Unix-based systems, or call the <code>CryptGenRandom</code> API in Windows-based systems, and only
use other techniques if the existing solutions are inadequate in certain respects or in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Whenever convenient--</p>

<ul>
<li>a programming language API should be safe for concurrent use by multiple threads, and</li>
<li>a new programming language&#39;s standard library should include methods corresponding to the two
given in the section <a href="#Random_Number_Extraction">&quot;Random Number Extraction&quot;</a> -- one set for unpredictable-random generators, and another set for statistical RNGs. </li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Shuffling></a></p>

<h3>Shuffling</h3>

<p>There are special considerations in play when applications use RNGs to shuffle a list of items.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Shuffling method.</strong> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher-Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffle method</a> shuffles a list such that all permutations of that list are equally likely to occur, assuming the RNG it uses produces uniformly random numbers and can generate all permutations of that list.  However, that method is also easy to get wrong; I give a correct implementation in <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/randomfunc.html">another document</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Generating all permutations.</strong> A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) can&#39;t generate all permutations of a list if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a> of the list&#39;s size is greater than the generator&#39;s <em>period</em>. This means that the items in a shuffled list of that size will never appear in certain orders when that generator is used to shuffle it. For example, a PRNG with period 2<sup>64</sup> (or one with a 64-bit state length) can&#39;t generate all permutations of a list with more than 20 items; with period 2<sup>128</sup>, more than 34 items; with period 2<sup>226</sup>, more than 52 items; and with period 2<sup>256</sup>, more than 57 items. When shuffling more than 20 items, a concerned application would be well advised--

<ul>
<li>to use an unpredictable-random implementation, or</li>
<li>if speed is a concern and security is not, to use a PRNG meeting the quality requirements of a statistical-random implementation and having a period at least as high as the number of permutations of the list to be shuffled, and to give that PRNG an <em>unpredictable seed</em>.
(See &quot;Lack of randomness&quot; in the <a href="https://sater.home.xs4all.nl/doc.html">BigDeal document by van Staveren</a> for further discussion.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><a id=Conclusion></a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, most applications that require random numbers usually want either unpredictability (cryptographic security), or speed and high quality. I believe that RNGs that meet the descriptions specified in the &quot;unpredictable-random implementations&quot; and &quot;Statistical RNGs&quot; sections will meet the needs of those applications.</p>

<p>What has motivated me to write a more rigorous definition of random number generators is the fact that many applications still use weak RNGs.  In my opinion, this is largely because most popular programming languages today--</p>

<ul>
<li>specify few and weak requirements on RNGs (such as C&#39;s <code>rand</code>),</li>
<li>specify a relatively weak general-purpose RNG (such as Java&#39;s <code>java.math.Random</code>, although it also includes a much stronger <code>SecureRandom</code> class),</li>
<li>implement RNGs by default that leave a bit to be desired (particularly the Mersenne Twister algorithm found in PHP&#39;s <code>mt_rand</code> as well as in Python and Ruby),</li>
<li>seed RNGs with a timestamp by default (such as the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h343ddh9.aspx">.NET Framework implementation of <code>System.Random</code></a>), and/or</li>
<li>leave the default seeding fixed or unspecified (such as C&#39;s <code>rand</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this document recommends using unpredictable-random implementations in many cases, especially in computer and information security contexts, and recommends easier programming interfaces for both unpredictable-random and statistical-random implementations in new programming languages.</p>
