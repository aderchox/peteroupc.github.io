<h1>Random Number Generator Recommendations for Applications</h1>

<p><a href="mailto:poccil14@gmail.com">Peter Occil</a></p>

<p>Begun on Mar. 5, 2016; last updated on June 19, 2017.</p>

<p>Most apps that use random numbers care about either unpredictability or speed/high quality.</p>

<p><a id=Introduction_and_Summary></a></p>

<h2>Introduction and Summary</h2>

<p>As I see it, there are two kinds of random number generators (RNGs) needed by most applications, namely--</p>

<ul>
<li><em>statistical-random generators</em>, which seek to generate numbers that follow a uniform random distribution, and</li>
<li><em>unpredictable-random generators</em>, which seek to generate numbers that are cost-prohibitive to predict.</li>
</ul>

<p>This page will discuss these two kinds of RNG, and make recommendations on their use and properties.</p>

<p>In addition, other applications require numbers that &quot;seem&quot; random but are based on an initial state, or &quot;seed&quot;.  This page will discuss when applications should specify their own seeds.</p>

<p>Then, this page will explain what programming language APIs implement statistical-random and unpredictable-random generators and give advice on implementing them in programming languages.</p>

<p>Finally, this page will discuss issues on the practical use of RNGs in applications, namely, shuffling and two higher-level randomness methods.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>The following definitions are helpful in better understanding this document.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pseudorandom number generator (PRNG).</strong> A number generator that outputs seemingly random numbers using a deterministic algorithm, that is, an algorithm that returns the same output for the same state every time. (In this document, RNGs include PRNGs.)</li>
<li><strong>Seed.</strong>  Arbitrary data for initializing the state of a PRNG.</li>
<li><strong>State length.</strong>  The maximum size of the seed a PRNG can take to initialize its state without truncating or compressing that seed.</li>
<li><strong>Period.</strong> The maximum number of random numbers a PRNG can generate in one sequence before the sequence repeats.  The period will not be greater than 2<sup><code>L</code></sup> where <code>L</code> is the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Unpredictable_Random_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Unpredictable-Random Generators</h2>

<p>Unpredictable-random implementations (also known as &quot;cryptographically strong&quot; or &quot;cryptographically secure&quot; RNGs) seek to generate random numbers that are cost-prohibitive to predict.  Such implementations are indispensable in computer security and information security contexts, such as--</p>

<ul>
<li> generating keying material, such as encryption keys,</li>
<li> generating random passwords or session identifiers,</li>
<li> generating &quot;salts&quot; to vary cryptographic hashes of the same password,</li>
<li> use in communications between two networked computers,</li>
<li> use in transfer, transport, messaging, and other communication protocols, and</li>
<li> use in networked games where predicting future random numbers would give a player an unfair advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are also useful in cases where the application generates random numbers so infrequently that the RNG&#39;s speed is not a concern.</p>

<p>An unpredictable-random implementation ultimately relies on one or more <em>nondeterministic sources</em> (sources that don&#39;t always return the same output for the same input) for random number generation.  Sources that are reasonably fast for most applications (for instance, by producing very many random bits per second), especially sources implemented in hardware, are highly advantageous here, since an implementation for which such sources are available can rely less on PRNGs, which are deterministic and benefit from reseeding to help ensure unpredictability (as explained later).</p>

<p><a id=Quality></a></p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>An unpredictable-random implementation generates uniformly random bits such that an outside party can guess neither prior nor future unseen bits of the random sequence correctly with more than a 50% chance per bit, even with knowledge of the randomness-generating procedure, the implementation&#39;s internal state at the given point in time, or extremely many outputs of the RNG. (If the sequence was generated directly by a PRNG, ensuring future bits are unguessable this way should be done wherever the implementation finds it feasible; see &quot;Seeding and Reseeding&quot;.)</p>

<p><a id=Seeding_and_Reseeding></a></p>

<h3>Seeding and Reseeding</h3>

<p>If an unpredictable-random implementation uses a PRNG, the following requirements apply.</p>

<p>The PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em> must be at least 128 bits and should be at least 256 bits.</p>

<p>Before an instance of the RNG generates a random number, it must have been initialized (&quot;seeded&quot;) with an <em>unpredictable seed</em>, defined as follows. The seed--</p>

<ul>
<li>must consist of data which meets the quality requirement described earlier, which ultimately derives from one or more nondeterministic sources, and no part of which may be the PRNG&#39;s own output (such data may be mixed with other arbitrary data as long as the result is no less cost-prohibitive to predict), and</li>
<li>must be at least the same size as the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The RNG should be reseeded from time to time (using a newly generated <em>unpredictable seed</em>) to help ensure the unpredictability of the output. If the implementation reseeds, it must do so before it generates more than 2<sup>67</sup> bits without reseeding and should do so before it generates more than 2<sup>32</sup> bits without reseeding.</p>

<p><a id=Examples></a></p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Examples of unpredictable-random implementations include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/dev/random</code> device on many Unix-based operating systems, which generally uses only nondeterministic sources; however, in some implementations of the device it can block for seconds at a time, especially if not enough randomness (&quot;entropy&quot;) is available.</li>
<li>The <code>/dev/urandom</code> device on many Unix-based operating systems, which often relies on both a PRNG and the same nondeterministic sources used by <code>/dev/random</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>CryptGenRandom</code> method on Windows.</li>
<li>Cryptographic hash functions that take very hard-to-predict signals as input (such as disk access timings, keystroke timings, thermal noise, and/or A. Seznec&#39;s hardware volatile entropy gathering and expansion technique).</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Statistical_Random_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Statistical-Random Generators</h2>

<p>Statistical-random generators are used in simulations, in numerical integration, and in many games to bring an element of chance and variation to the application, with the goal that each possible outcome is equally likely. However, statistical-random generators are generally suitable only if--</p>

<ul>
<li> computer security and information security are not involved, and</li>
<li> the application generates random numbers so frequently that it would slow down undesirably if an unpredictable-random implementation were used instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>If more than 20 items are being shuffled, a concerned application would be well advised to use alternatives to this kind of implementation (see <a href="#Shuffling">&quot;Shuffling&quot;</a>).</p>

<p>A statistical-random implementation is usually implemented with a PRNG, but can also be implemented in a similar way as an unpredictable-random implementation provided it remains reasonably fast.</p>

<p><a id=Quality_2></a></p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>A statistical-random implementation generates random bits, each of which is uniformly randomly distributed independently of the other bits, at least for nearly all practical purposes. The implementation must be highly likely to pass all the tests used in <code>TestU01</code>&#39;s <code>Crush</code>, <code>SmallCrush</code>, and <code>BigCrush</code> test batteries [L&#39;Ecuyer and Simard 2007], and should be highly likely to pass other known statistical randomness tests. The RNG need not be equidistributed. (Mentioning specific test batteries here is in the interest of precision and makes it clearer whether a particular RNG meets these quality requirements.)</p>

<p><a id=Seeding_and_Reseeding_2></a></p>

<h3>Seeding and Reseeding</h3>

<p>If statistical-random implementation uses a PRNG, the following requirements apply.</p>

<p>The PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em> must be at least 64 bits, should be at least 128 bits, and is encouraged to be as high as the implementation can go to remain reasonably fast for most applications.</p>

<p>Before an instance of the RNG generates a random number, it must have been initialized (&quot;seeded&quot;) with a seed described as follows. The seed--</p>

<ul>
<li>must consist of data not known <em>a priori</em> by the implementation, such as random bits from an unpredictable-random implementation,</li>
<li>must not be a fixed value or a user-entered value,</li>
<li>should not be trivially predictable in any of its bits, as far as practical,</li>
<li>is encouraged not to consist of a timestamp (especially not a timestamp with millisecond or coarser precision)<sup>(1)</sup>, and</li>
<li>must be at least the same size as the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The implementation is encouraged to reseed itself from time to time (using a newly generated seed as described earlier), especially if the PRNG has a <em>state length</em> less than 238 bits. If the implementation reseeds, it should do so before it generates more values than the square root of the PRNG&#39;s period without reseeding.</p>

<p><a id=Examples_and_Non_Examples></a></p>

<h3>Examples and Non-Examples</h3>

<p>Examples of statistically-random generators include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>xoroshiro128+</code> (state length 128 bits; nonzero seed).</li>
<li><code>xorshift128+</code> (state length 128 bits; nonzero seed).</li>
<li><code>Lehmer128</code> (state length 128 bits).</li>
<li><code>JKISS</code> on top of page 3 of Jones 2010 (state length 128 bits; seed with four 32-bit nonzero pieces).</li>
<li>C++&#39;s <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/ranlux48/"><code>ranlux48</code> engine</a> (state length 577 bits; nonzero seed).</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-examples include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mersenne Twister shows a <a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/#quality">systematic failure</a> in one of the <code>BigCrush</code> tests. (See also S. Vigna, &quot;<a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/xorshift.pdf">An experimental exploration of Marsaglia&#39;s <code>xorshift</code> generators, scrambled</a>&quot;, as published in the <code>xoroshiro128+</code> website.)</li>
<li>Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> with modulus 2<sup>63</sup> or less (such as <code>java.util.Random</code> and C++&#39;s <code>minstd_rand</code> and <code>minstd_rand0</code> engines) has a <em>state length</em> of less than 64 bits.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Seeded_Random_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Seeded Random Generators</h2>

<p>In addition, some applications use pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate results based on apparently-random principles, starting from a known initial state, or &quot;seed&quot;. One notable example is a &quot;code&quot;, or password, for generating a particular game level in some role-playing games.</p>

<p>Applications that need to specify their own seeds usually care about reproducible results. (Note that in the definitions for <a href="#Unpredictable_Random_Generators">unpredictable-random</a> and <a href="#Statistical_Random_Generators">statistical-random</a> generators given earlier, the PRNGs involved are automatically seeded before use.)</p>

<p><a id=Seeding_Recommendations></a></p>

<h3>Seeding Recommendations</h3>

<p>An application should use a PRNG with a seed it specifies (rather than an automatically-initialized PRNG or another kind of RNG) only if--</p>

<ol>
<li>the initial state (the seed) which the &quot;random&quot; result will be generated from--

<ul>
<li>is hard-coded,</li>
<li>was entered by the user,</li>
<li>was generated using a statistical or unpredictable-random implementation (as defined earlier), or</li>
<li>is based on a timestamp (but only if the reproducible result is not intended to vary during the time specified on the timestamp and within the timestamp&#39;s granularity; for example, a year/month/day timestamp for a result that varies only daily),</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the application needs to generate the same &quot;random&quot; result multiple times,</li>
<li> the application finds it impractical to store or distribute that &quot;random&quot; result without having to use a PRNG with an application-specified seed, such as--

<ul>
<li>  by saving the result to a file, or</li>
<li>  by distributing the results or the random numbers to networked users as they are generated,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the random number generation method will remain <em>stable</em> for as long as the relevant feature is still in use by the application, and</li>
<li>any feature using that random number generation method to generate that &quot;random&quot; result will remain backward compatible with respect to the &quot;random&quot; results it generates, for as long as that feature is still in use by the application.</li>
</ol>

<p>(A random number generation method is <em>stable</em> if it uses a PRNG, outputs the same random sequence given the same seed, and has no random-number generation behavior that is unspecified, that is implementation-dependent, or that may change in the future.  For example, <code>java.util.Random</code> is stable, while the C <code>rand</code> method is not.)</p>

<p><a id=Seedable_PRNG_Recommendations></a></p>

<h3>Seedable PRNG Recommendations</h3>

<p>Which PRNG to use for generating reproducible results depends on the application. But here are some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li> Any PRNG algorithm selected for producing reproducible results should meet or exceed the quality requirements of a statistical-random implementation, and should be reasonably fast.</li>
<li> The PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em> should be 64 bits or greater.</li>
<li> Any seed passed to the PRNG should be at least the same size as the PRNG&#39;s <em>state length</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Other_Situations></a></p>

<h3>Other Situations</h3>

<p>Seeds also come into play in other situations, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verifiable randomness.</strong> <em>Verifiable random numbers</em> are random numbers (such as randomly generated seeds) that are disclosed along with all the information required to verify their generation.  Usually, of the information used to derive such numbers, at least some of it is not known by anyone until some time after the announcement is made that those numbers will be generated, but all of it will eventually be publicly available.  In some cases, some of the information required to verify the numbers&#39; generation is disclosed in the announcement that those numbers will be generated.</p>

<p>One process to generate verifiable random numbers is described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3797.txt">RFC 3797</a> (to the extent its advice is not specific to the Internet Engineering Task Force or its Nominations Committee).  Although the source code given in that RFC uses the MD5 algorithm, the process does not preclude the use of hash algorithms stronger than MD5 (see the last paragraph of section 3.3 of that RFC).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Noise.</strong> Randomly generated numbers can serve as <em>noise</em>, that is, a randomized variation in images and sound.   The RNG used to generate the noise--</p>

<ul>
<li>must be an unpredictable-random implementation, if computer or information security is involved; otherwise,</li>
<li>must follow the <a href="#Seedable_PRNG_Recommendations">seedable PRNG recommendations</a>, if the <a href="#Seeding_Recommendations">seeding recommendations</a> apply to the noise generation; otherwise,</li>
<li>must be a statistical-random or unpredictable-random implementation, if the RNG is not used solely to generate noise; otherwise,</li>
<li>need only be as strong as required to achieve the desired effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>(A detailed description of noise algorithms, such as white, pink, or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise">colored noise</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a>, or fractal Brownian motion, is outside the scope of this page.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Programming_Language_APIs></a></p>

<h2>Programming Language APIs</h2>

<p>The following table lists techniques, methods, and functions that implement
unpredictable-random and statistical-random RNGs for popular programming languages. For both kinds of generators it&#39;s encouraged to use a single application-wide instance of the RNG implementation. Methods and libraries mentioned in the &quot;Statistical-random&quot; column need to be initialized with a full-length seed before use.</p>

<p>The mention of a third-party library in this section does not imply sponsorship or endorsement
of that library, or imply a preference of that library over others. The list is not comprehensive.</p>

<p>(1) Default general RNG implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne Twister</a>, which doesn&#39;t
meet the statistical-random requirements, strictly speaking, but may be adequate for many applications due to its extremely long period.</p>

<p>(2) JavaScript&#39;s <code>Math.random</code> is implemented using <code>xorshift128+</code> in the latest V8 engine, Firefox, and certain other modern browsers at the time of writing; the exact algorithm to be used by JavaScript&#39;s <code>Math.random</code> is &quot;implementation-dependent&quot;, though, according to the ECMAScript specification.</p>

<p>(3) Read from the <code>/dev/urandom</code> and/or <code>/dev/random</code> devices in Unix-based systems (both devices can generally be read from in the same way as disk files), or call the <code>CryptGenRandom</code> API in Windows-based systems (see <a href="#Advice_for_New_Programming_Language_APIs">&quot;Advice for New Programming Language APIs&quot;</a>).</p>

<p>(4) Java&#39;s <code>java.util.Random</code> class uses a 48-bit seed, so doesn&#39;t meet the statistical-random requirements.</p>

<p>(5) In my opinion, Ruby&#39;s <code>Random#rand</code> method presents a beautiful and simple API for random number generation.</p>

<p><a id=Advice_for_New_Programming_Language_APIs></a></p>

<h2>Advice for New Programming Language APIs</h2>

<p>Wherever possible, existing libraries or techniques that already meet the requirements for unpredictable-random and statistical-random RNGs should be used.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>An unpredictable-random implementation can read from the <code>/dev/urandom</code> and/or <code>/dev/random</code> devices in Unix-based systems, or call the <code>CryptGenRandom</code> API in Windows-based systems, and only use other techniques if the existing solutions are inadequate in certain respects or in certain circumstances.</li>
<li>A statistical-random implementation can use a PRNG algorithm mentioned as an example in the <a href="#Statistical_Random_Generators">statistical-random generator</a> section.</li>
</ul>

<p>If existing solutions are inadequate, a programming language API could implement unpredictable-random and statistical-random RNGs by filling an output byte buffer with random bytes, where each bit in each byte will be randomly set to 0 or 1.  For instance, a C language API for unpredictable-random generators could look like the following: <code>int random(uint8_t[] bytes, size_t size);</code>, where &quot;bytes&quot; is a pointer to a byte array, and &quot;size&quot; is the number of random bytes to generate, and where 0 is returned if the method succeeds and nonzero otherwise. Any programming language API that implements such RNGs by filling a byte buffer must run in amortized linear time on the number of random bytes the API will generate.</p>

<p>Unpredictable-random and statistical-random implementations--</p>

<ul>
<li>should be reasonably fast for most applications, and</li>
<li>should be safe for concurrent use by multiple threads, whenever convenient.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, a new programming language&#39;s standard library should include methods corresponding to the two given in the section <a href="#Random_Number_Extraction">&quot;Random Number Extraction&quot;</a> -- one set for unpredictable-random generators, and another set for statistical RNGs.</p>

<p><a id=Using_Random_Number_Generators></a></p>

<h2>Using Random Number Generators</h2>

<p>The following topics deal with the practical use of RNGs in applications.  Unless stated otherwise,
they apply regardless of the kind of RNG used (such as an unpredictable-random or statistical-random implementation).</p>

<p><a id=Random_Number_Extraction></a></p>

<h3>Random Number Extraction</h3>

<p>Two methods given below can serve as building blocks for writing code that makes practical use
of randomness. Both methods assume the underlying RNG produces uniformly random bits.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first method is to generate a random integer from 0 inclusive to N exclusive (here
called <code>RNDINT(N)</code>), where N is an integer greater than 0. To do so, use the RNG to generate as many
random bits as used to represent N-minus-1, then convert those bits to a nonnegative integer.
If that nonnegative integer is N or greater, repeat this process.</li>
<li>The second method is to generate a random number from 0 inclusive to 1 exclusive. This can be
implemented by calling <code>RNDINT(X)</code> and dividing by X without rounding the result to an integer, where X is an integer which is the number of fractional parts between 0 and 1.  For 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point numbers
(Java <code>double</code>), X will be 2<sup>53</sup>.  For 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point numbers
(Java <code>float</code>), X will be 2<sup>24</sup>. (See &quot;Generating uniform doubles in the unit interval&quot; in the <a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/#remarks"><code>xoroshiro+</code> remarks page</a>
for further discussion.)</li>
</ol>

<p>A detailed discussion of other methods to generate random numbers or integers that
follow a given distribution, such as a normal, geometric, binomial, or discrete weighted
distribution, or that fall within a given range, is outside the scope of this page, however;  I have written about this in <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/randomfunc.html">another document</a>.</p>

<p><a id=Shuffling></a></p>

<h3>Shuffling</h3>

<p>There are special considerations in play when applications use RNGs to shuffle a list of items.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Shuffling method.</strong> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher-Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffle method</a> shuffles a list such that all permutations of that list are equally likely to occur, assuming the RNG it uses produces uniformly random numbers and can generate all permutations of that list.  However, that method is also easy to get wrong; I give a correct implementation in <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/randomfunc.html">another document</a>.</li>
<li><p><strong>Generating all permutations.</strong> A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) can&#39;t generate all permutations of a list if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a> of the list&#39;s size is greater than the generator&#39;s <em>period</em>. This means that the items in a shuffled list of that size will never appear in certain orders when that generator is used to shuffle it. For example, a PRNG with period 2<sup>64</sup> (or one with a 64-bit state length) can&#39;t generate all permutations of a list with more than 20 items; with period 2<sup>128</sup>, more than 34 items; with period 2<sup>226</sup>, more than 52 items; and with period 2<sup>256</sup>, more than 57 items. When shuffling more than 20 items, a concerned application would be well advised--</p>

<ul>
<li>to use an unpredictable-random implementation, or</li>
<li>if speed is a concern and computer and information security is not, to use a PRNG--

<ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In this document, I made the distinction between <em>statistical-random</em> and <em>unpredictable-random</em> generators because that is how programming languages often present random number generators -- they usually offer a general-purpose RNG (such as C&#39;s <code>rand</code> or Java&#39;s <code>java.util.Random</code>) and sometimes an RNG intended for security purposes (such as <code>java.security.SecureRandom</code>).</p>

<p>What has motivated me to write a more rigorous definition of random number generators is the fact that many applications still use weak RNGs.  In my opinion, this is largely because most popular programming languages today--</p>

<ul>
<li>specify few and weak requirements on RNGs (such as C&#39;s <code>rand</code>),</li>
<li>specify a relatively weak general-purpose RNG (such as Java&#39;s <code>java.math.Random</code>, although it also includes a much stronger <code>SecureRandom</code> class),</li>
<li>implement RNGs by default that leave a bit to be desired (particularly the Mersenne Twister algorithm found in PHP&#39;s <code>mt_rand</code> as well as in Python and Ruby),</li>
<li>seed RNGs with a timestamp by default (such as the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h343ddh9.aspx">.NET Framework implementation of <code>System.Random</code></a>), and/or</li>
<li>leave the default seeding fixed or unspecified (such as C&#39;s <code>rand</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p><a id=Conclusion></a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, most applications that require random numbers usually want either unpredictability (cryptographic security), or speed and high quality. I believe that RNGs that meet the descriptions specified in the &quot;unpredictable-random implementations&quot; and &quot;Statistical RNGs&quot; sections will meet the needs of those applications.</p>

<p>In addition, this document recommends using unpredictable-random implementations in many cases, especially in computer and information security contexts, and recommends easier programming interfaces for both unpredictable-random and statistical-random implementations in new programming languages.</p>

<h3>Request for Comments</h3>

<p>Feel free to send comments. They may help improve this page.</p>

<p>Comments on any aspect of the document are welcome, but answers to the following would be particularly appreciated.</p>

<ul>
<li> Have I characterized the randomness needs of applications properly?</li>
<li> Did I cover the vast majority of applications that require randomness?</li>
<li> Are there existing programming language APIs or software libraries, not mentioned in this document, that already meet the requirements for unpredictable-random or statistical-random RNGs?</li>
<li> Are there certain kinds of applications that require a different kind of RNG (unpredictable-random, statistical-random, seeded, etc.) than I recommended?</li>
<li>In a typical computer a consumer would have today:

<ul>
<li>How many random numbers per second would an unpredictable-random implementation generate? A statistical-random implementation?</li>
<li>How many random numbers per second does a typical application using RNGs generate? Are there applications that usually generate considerably more random numbers than that per second?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><sup>(1)</sup> This statement appears because multiple instances of a PRNG automatically seeded with a timestamp, when they are created at the same time, run the risk of starting with the same seed and therefore generating the same sequence of random numbers.</p>
