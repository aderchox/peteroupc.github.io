<h1>Arbitrary-Exponent Numbers</h1>
<p>
This document registers tags for arbitrary-exponent numbers in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (ref. 1).
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tag:   264
<li>Data item: array
<li>Semantics: Decimal fraction with arbitrary exponent
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tag:   265
<li>Data item: array
<li>Semantics: Bigfloat with arbitrary exponent
</ul>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
The CBOR specification already defines two tags for arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers: tag 4 for decimal
fractions, and 5 for bigfloats.  But unfortunately, both tags limit the exponent to major types 0 and 1 (about 65 bits), and some number formats,
notably the one used in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, ref. 2), don't have a theoretical limit on exponents.
For example, it would be impractical to serialize the JSON number <code>10e+99999999999999999999</code> in tag 4, or the number <code>10e-99999999999999999999</code>
in tag 4 without loss of information, since in both cases, the exponent doesn't fit the range of major types 0 or 1.
The tags defined here are intended to make it possible to serialize numbers like these by allowing the exponent to be
a big integer.
</p>
<h2>
Detailed Semantics
</h2>
<p>
Tag 264 has the same semantics as tag 4, except that the exponent can also be a bignum (major type 6, tag 2 or 3).
</p>
<p>
Tag 265 has the same semantics as tag 5, except that the exponent can also be a bignum (major type 6, tag 2 or 3).
</p>
<p>
If a number's exponent is less than 1<sup>64</sup>, and not less than -(1<sup>64</sup>), an implementation may
use tag 4 or 5 instead, but this behavior is not required.
</p>
<p>
A CBOR decoder can treat data items with tag 264 or 265 that don't meet the criteria above as an error,
but this specification doesn't define how a CBOR implementation ought to behave in this case.
Section 3.4 of RFC 7049 (ref. 1) details this kind of error-handling behavior.
